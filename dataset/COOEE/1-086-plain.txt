Sydney, Saturday, October, 20, 1804
The dreadful thunder-storm from the south-west, at about half-past one o'clock last Tuesday afternoon was the worst tempest experienced in this Colony; although it did not exceed 35 minutes yet every low situation was simply deluged by the rain, while the humble cottage was almost afloat. The lightning was excessively vivid, and from the close succession of the thunder there was considerable apprehension of its consequences but only one serious accident was occasioned by the violent blast.
We are extremely concerned to report that the very fine vessel, Lady Barlow, Captain M'Askill, was overset and sunk at the King's outer Moorings, in five fathoms and a half water, but happily only one of her people, a lascar, was lost.
It was first considered, as the dreadful accident immediately succeeded a remarkably vivid flash of lightning, that it had struck and penetrated through the vessel's hull, but it has since transpired that the real cause of the disaster was the violent initial wind which caught the unfortunate vessel broadside on and bore her over on her beam-ends.
Assistance was immediately rendered both from the shore and from other vessels in the port. His Excellency Governor King, went off in a whale-boat, and tendered to the captain every possible aid. Captain Farrell of the Fair American, had already hove abreast of the ship, then lying upon her broadside, her weather side nearly level with the surface of the water.
The Investigator, commanded by Lieutenant Houstoun, by His Excellency's order was warped along-side of the Lady Barlow; the Government punt attended, to take in such of the cordage and other rigging as should necessarily be cut away. Tackles were lashed to the masts of the Fair American, and passed round those of the Lady Barlow, to prevent any more unfavourable change in her position, as no effort to raise her could then be effectual, as she could not be released from her mooring chain.
She continued thus during the night, but by the evening of the following day, owing to the activity and prodigious perseverance used, her masts were raised several feet, and supported by the Investigator. Between the hours of 11 and 12 in the forenoon of Thursday, we had the satisfaction to behold her upright, though full of water, sustained by the two vessels above mentioned.
To effect this desirable circumstance, every prompt and effectual assistance was given by every indivual in the Settlement, whose aid could be servicable on so melancholy an occasion.
The loss occasioned by the unfortunate event cannot be readily estimated; but we are extremely concerned to state that Captain M'Askill's loss is very considerable indeed. The whole of the provisions have also perished, as well as the whole private property belonging to the officers and other individuals. Much of the oil recently put onboard by Mr. Campbell has been washed out, and vast quantities floated in by the tides.
A young woman was nearly lost by drowning. She happened, more by good luck than any other cause, to be seated near one of the larboard ports when the ship heeled; and presenting herself at the porthole, she was dragged out by a seaman, humanely disposed to save her life at the hazard of his own, - but finding himself unable to support both her and himself, after swimming a short distance, he then surrendered her to the destinies. Fortunately, Mr. Harris was nearby in his boat and by timely interposition this Gentleman rescued the young woman from her watery fate.
It was extremely providential that the disaster happened at the moment when the crew were upon deck, and the convict working hands, who had been chiefly employed in the holds in the forenoon, were on shore to dinner.
