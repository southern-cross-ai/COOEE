Dear Madam
Though I have wrote to you not long ago yet I am induced to give you a line again by this conveyance. I have sent to England my oldest daughter Ann under the care of a Mr, & Mrs. Cover and have directed them to wait upon you with Ann before she goes down into Yorkshire. Mr. Cover is a worthy man and has conducted himself with great propriety in this settlement. He was sent out in the ship Duff on the mission to these Islands in our Seas. I shall refer you to him for any particular information.
You will wish to hear how the Kingdom of our Lord succeeds among us. I am sorry to say appearances are worse than ever. Satans Kingdom Seems to be so fully established and his power and influence so universal among us that nothing but an uncommon display of Almighty power can shake his throne, My situation becomes disgusting and painful to the last degree. I long to quit the Colony and retire from such scenes of ungodliness and wrong. Our friends can form little more idea of our situation in this Country than they can of the invisible regions.  I have made application to Government to return. Whether I shall obtain permission or no I know not. If I do you may expect me in London in about 18 months, God willing, after you receive this. Should any material change take place so as to afford any prospect of real good to this Colony I might be induced to remain longer. This depends wholly on circumstances. I think it probable Mr. Johnson will return soon it is his present determination to do so. We may say on our departure from this country we have been fairly hunted out of the settlement. Our life is one continued scene of contention and opposition from the beginning to the end of the year. Besides living where iniquity abounds so much and our civil connexion with the worst of men render our souls dry and barren.
We feel little of that real vital spiritual life which is so essential to the happiness and progress of the real Christian. To be cut off from all the society and conversation of the righteous and to hold a situation in the state that calls you forth to act continually with wicked men in power is painful and distressing. We are not situated in this country like clergymen in England who have only to attend to their studies & their flocks. Many other unpleasant duties devolve upon me. In the midst of all my only consolation is the Lord knows how I am situated and foreknew it. I sometimes hope I am doing his will ever under a dark & thick cloud. The end will come by and by, we shall then see why & wherefore we have met with this & that trial. In every difficulty I have cause to be thankful for good health. Mrs. M. enjoys the same and our little family. Mrs. M. would have wrote but has been so busy getting Ann ready for sea and having only got her bed about eight weeks ago, therefore hopes you will excuse her. It was my intention to have made you a collection of the seeds of this country and to have sent it by this ship knowing they would have been taken care of but it has not been in my power for want of time. The few I had collected with a branch belonging to each kind according to their number I have sent you under the care of Mr. Cover - am sorry they are so few. They are all new and fresh and gathered with my own hands. Mr. Cover will inform you how few spare moments I have. I am busy in building a Church at Parramatta. Shall be happy to see it completed. I think it would never be done if I was to leave the settlement.  I can only say it is my present intention and wish to quit the colony yet my times are in the Lords hands, it will be enough if I am found faithful when my work comes to be done. The building of an Orphan house is another object which lies near my heart. I shall feel uncommon satisfaction in having it carried into execution. The number of poor children in this colony I pity who have either no parents or would have been better at this moment if they had never known them. I shall say nothing of the monopolies extortions and oppressions of the great, and the wickedness poverty and ruin of the lower ranks of the inhabitants of N.S.W. You will hear of these things from other quarters. They will and must become a national concern speedily or you will hear of the murder of the greatest part of us by & by. Let me beg dear Madam an interest in your prayers. May the Lord bless you and yours. Give my kindest respects to Mr. Stokes. Mrs. M. joins me in every Christian respect.
I remain
Dear Madam
Yours sincerely
SAMUEL MARSDEN.
