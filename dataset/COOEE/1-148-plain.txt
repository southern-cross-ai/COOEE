GOVERNMENT HOUSE, SYDNEY, SATURDAY, 19th AUGUST, 1815.
1. It appearing that the Government Public Notice bearing Date the 22d September, 1810, and published in the Sydney Gazette of that Date, prohibiting all Persons from walking in the Government Garden and Domain at Parramatta, unless properly authorised to do so, has not been fully understood or attended to; His Excellency the GOVERNOR is now pleased to direct and command, that no Person shall hereafter enter, or walk in the said Garden or Domain, except for the Purpose of transacting Business with His EXCELLENCY or some Person of his Establishment, or having a written Order for that purpose from the GOVERNOR, or from one of the Gentlemen of His Family, or from Mr. Richard Rouse, the Superintendant of Government Works at Parramatta; who is hereby authorised to grant Permission at his Discretion to any respectable Free Persons who may wish to see the Grounds, taking Care that the Gardener shall be on such Occasions in Attendance on them.
The Gardener, and all the other Servants at Government House in Parramatta, are at the same Time strictly prohibited from admitting Strangers either into the Domain or Garden, or to view the Inside of the House, unless with such written Order as is herein prescribed.
2. Persons presuming to force a Thoroughfare or Passage through the Government Garden or enclosed Domain after this Notification, will be prosecuted for the Trespass according to Law. All Animals found feeding in the Domain, and not belonging to Government, are to be impounded until due Compensation shall be made for the Injury sustained; and any Person who shall be found to drive Sheep, Pigs, Goats, or other Animals into the Domain, will be punished in a most exemplary Manner.
3. The Government Garden and Domain at Windsor being now also fenced in and enclosed, the same Regulations in all Respects are to take place there, as are prescribed for the Government Garden, Domain, and House at Parramatta, except, that instead of Mr. Richard Rouse giving Permissions in Addition to those from His EXCELLENCY, or the Gentlemen of his Family, they are only to be granted at Windsor by Mr. Richard Fitzgerald, the Superintendant of Public Works at that Place.
His Honor the Lieutenant Governor, Officers at the Heads of Departments, and the Magistrates of the Territory, are to be exempt from the above Regulations, and have at all Times an unrestrained Access to the Gardens and Domains of Government, both at Parramatta and Windsor.
by Command of His Excellency the Governor,
John Thomas CAMPBELL, Secretary
