He stays at the hotel at Tambo Crossing where the Post Office is also, a kind of wayside hotel where the mail coach stops on its route. He has his horse to ride to and from the land. No doubt he will give you more particulars, some time when he writes, than I can. However you may not be surprised if he does not write very often as he will be tired.
