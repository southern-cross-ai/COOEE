Government House,
Sydney, Nov. 14th, 1896.
Dear Sir, 
Your letter and enclosures of the 31st ultimo, relating to the Bathurst Convention, have been forwarded to me during my absence from Perth, and I think your attention may have been drawn to some remarks on the subject of Federation made by me at the Mayoral banquet at Melbourne on the 9th inst.
If this is so, I need only now add that the published report of my speech is substantially correct, and that you are at liberty to accept it as the expression of my views on this important question. 
There is but one way of bringing home to the people the advantages of Federation, viz., by the holding of meetings or Conventions such as you have in prospect, by the formation of branch associations in every important district, and by the dissemination of sound and wholesome literature on this subject.
It is only thus that a fatal and demoralising apathy can be made to give way to the enthusiasm which will confer that mandate upon the respective Colonial Governments which alone they wait for, and, which when presented by the popular voice and vote, it will be neither their interest nor desire to disregard. 
I am, yours 
faithfully,
GERARD SMITH.
T. A. Machattie, Esq., M.B., etc.
