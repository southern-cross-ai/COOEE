SIR, - We the Municipal Council and inhabitants of Fremantle offer you and your brave comrades our warmest congratulations on the successful completion of your long and trying journey, through what has been hitherto an unknown country, and your safe arrival at the principal port of the colony of Western Australia.
The difficulties to be overcome in the work of Australian exploration are acknowledged to be as formidable as are to be found in any part of our globe, and to meet these difficulties requires a combination of intelligence, energy, perseverance, and fortitude that few men possess; and the fact that you have surmounted all obstacles, and borne up under so many privations, has awakened in all our minds the deepest feelings of gratitude and admiration.
The discoveries now to be revealed to the world by your report of the country through which you have passed will be not only an acquisition to scientific knowledge, but a boon to the growing population of this island continent, destined, we believe, at some future day, to be the seat of a great, a free, and intelligent nation.
Among the names of the pioneers of civilization, yours, sir, will hold a distinguished place; and when we remember with regret, that so many brave men - such as Leichhardt, Burke, and Wills - have perished in similar attempts to explore the unknown portions of Australia, we rejoice that you and your companions in your journey are spared to receive our congratulations. 
We are deeply grateful to Almighty God, by Whose kind Providence your lives have been preserved, and it is our hope, sir, that you may live for many years in the enjoyment of health and strength, cheered by the esteem of your fellow-men, and with the consciousness that you have accomplished a great and noble work.
Signed on behalf of the Town Council and inhabitants of Fremantle,
W. E. Marmion,
Chairman, Town Council.
Fremantle, March, 1874."
