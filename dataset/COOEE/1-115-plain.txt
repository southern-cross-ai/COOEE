When I went I found him at the head of his armed men, and in the presence of Doctor Townson, John and Gregory Blaxland, Garnham Blaxwell, Charles Grimes, Surgeon Jamison, Nicholas Bayly, Hannibal McArthur, and Edward McArthur; he pronounced a speech similar to the letter before stated. I was now directed to have no communication with any person whom I had been accustomed to see as a friend; even my secretary, Mr Griffin, was ordered from me and was hurried before a committee - martial law having been proclaimed - and, in the midst of terror, interrogated respecting my conduct and concerns as Governor.
