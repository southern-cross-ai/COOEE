 I suppose Mr. McVicker will be in Melbourne in little over a week. I will do any little thing I can for him but it is indeed very little that I can do. Of course I can introduce him to Mr. Agnew and I suppose that is the best I can. I hope he may be fortunate in getting a situation but as far as I can understand things are a little dull just now. 
There is a young man from Belfast, a grocer, who came out in the Liguria with us, and went to a situation up country shortly after we came, but about three weeks ago he left his situation to try and get one in Melbourne. He has been looking about a good deal and has not been successful yet. I see him very often; indeed he often calls on me to have a walk and a talk; of course he is likely to fall in before long, but not so quickly as he would like. John says that times are bad in Queensland owing to the drought. I believe Mr. Gowan would be better to come to Victoria. Queensland is very warm and rough. Victoria is quite hot enough for anyone to work in. There is not much land to be taken up now but he has plenty of money and could buy a farm. Up the Goulburn improved farms sell from £6 to £10 pounds an acre freehold. There are other districts where farms can be rented but I can pretend to say very little about it as I know very little. The climate of Victoria is well suited for any person with chest complaint 
There is some talk about unemployed labourers and scarcity of work yet I see by the papers that farmers in some districts cannot get a sufficient number of hands to get their crop in. These said unemployed turn up their noses if they do not get a high rate of wages and will not work for low wages so they are not so much to be pitied.
