We will be able to live together there if we can get our ideas carried out. Mrs. Welby the woman whom I am staying with has sold this cottage and purposes taking a cottage at Clifden Hill to suit us. John is anxious for this and so am I as she is a very nice person and tuckers well I may here tell you that I have eaten more flesh meat since I came to the colony than I did in two years at home. I have a plate of nice porridge and new milk every morning except Sunday and a nice chop or fresh fish or rabbit with tea and toast  
he gives the landlady the extra 2s. so that he can have anything he fancies such as a couple of raw eggs beat up in tea, coffee or milk when he is going to bed or working late. He has been on the late shift this week and has not done till 11.30pm; pretty late isn't it? But again he does not start until 11.00 o'clock when on this shift. I generally take him in a good plate of porridge and he has that in bed. Then he has a snooze, rises at 10, has breakfast and goes to work and knocks off at about 4 or 4.30 for a spell, has dinner returns to work at 6.30. The night work is not good for him. I am surprised to see how he stood the winter and a pretty severe one too. I believe if he had only to work during the day that he would get rid of his cough  We three are trying to save what money we can as we purpose investing in a farm or select. We have been getting information from a young man from Derry (Ireland) who has taken up a selection and I intend when on my holidays going to see the country where land is available and convenient to where this young man has selected.  If it was a good bee country they would be a good industry. 
I shall not dwell further on the subject as I cannot say much about it until I see the place. John intends sticking to the tram company until he runs a bit of a cheque together. If the land already mentioned is not selected or taken up the opportunity slips and in a few years good land will not be to had in a reasonable distance from a railway or township. 
The already mentioned regarding land we wish to be kept among yourselves strictly secret.
