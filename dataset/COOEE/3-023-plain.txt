April 21 1851
My Dear Sir,
Mrs. Brown having written so fully on general matters I merely beg to acknowledge your very kind letter of the 26 of September 1850 received on the 17 of this month.
I much regret you have suffered so much of late. Mrs. Brown grieves to think that she shall see your face no more in this world but I have still a lingering hope that I shall see you in the course of a few years. There is much before me in the interim to do and battle with. If I gain the victory of overcoming my difficulties it will be a pleasing interview on both sides.
Mrs. Brown and myself wrote to you in the month of December last which letters I trust you have received. In some way or other I will not fail to raise you the two thousand pounds if you do not comply with our proposals made in those letters, and that I think will be best done by the sale of Grass Dale.
I expect Mrs. B and myself with Kenneth will leave this in about a fortnight for Champion Bay and on my return I shall write to you very fully.  I am greatly obliged for the attention you have paid to my affairs in England. I do not know what I shall do when you are unable to give it your attention. I am quite of your opinion with respect to Piercy but I suppose we must put up with him for the present.
I am glad the account at Morrells stands so well as it does.
I remain
My Dear Sir
Yours very Truly
Thos Brown
