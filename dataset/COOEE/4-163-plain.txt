The same measure does her still. Make the skirt pretty plain as they are easiest washed. Also two or three aprons. Let some be checked linen and some spotted or checked muslin; more of a dress with lace, a pretty good size also a pair of corsets 27 inches not too expensive. She gave 7s. 6d. for a pair and not very good at that. You might put in a few bits of lace and a few cheap handkerchiefs, imitation of silk to wear round our necks in the summer and a piece of Indian muslin or any kind of old fashioned muslin scarf to tie round my own hat in the summer. Mrs. Henry can tell you what we wear. 
Suzie will not need any dresses as Mrs. Newson is making some out of hers but you might send her some white pinnies with a good deal of Swiss work. Mrs. Watson's suited her very well only too short as she is 3 feet 5 1/4 inches long in her little shoes. She is in very good health and as good a colour as if she was at home. 
She has just minded about a black lustre apron a good size at about 14 or 16 pence. If James does not come it does not matter I would not like to trouble any other body. He could tell them that Sarah's things is the wife's.
