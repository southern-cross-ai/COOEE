My Dear Cousin
It is so long since I have had the pleasure of receiving letter from you that I do not knew whether to say you have forgotten me or not, however I will be like the merciful Judge and not condemn you but attribute it not to want of affection towards me but merely because you do not think it any consequence to write to a "wee bit body" like Cousin Eliza, now is not this the case? but now I will so far condesend no to make an apology to you, for my long silence and I hope when my dear Cousin understands why it had been so long he will pardon it, of course you will have heard all the particulars of our late melancholy and severe loss, and I am sure my Cousin will not be surprized at my not writing him when I assure him that ever since that fatal event, my heart has been too sad almost to write to any one, particularly one I am connected with for I am aware that when writing to a Relation I must nesesarily mention what I would most willingly avoid for whenever it is mentioned it seems as though my wounds bleed afresh, not that it is ever out of my thought no, night and day and every hour it dwells upon my mind, I am sure my Friend will enter into all my feelings on such a Subject, it is one that my immagination never led me to suppose would fall to my lot to record, oh little did I think when I gave my Sister the last Embrace when I was leaving Sydney that it would be the last time in this world that I should hold so beloved and affectionate a relative to my heart, and that her days where numbered to so short a span, that that lovely form was so soon to mingle with her kindred dust, so soon be numbered with the dead: so soon to lay down her head in the Grave, she drooped like a beautious Flower, that for a short time spread a fragrance around, and before the Evening Sun goes down, droops whithers, and dies, but she died in the Faith of her Redeemer never once did she repine, she used to say "do not weep but pray for me the Lords will be done", she might have exclaimed, "oh Death where is thy sting" she bore all her sufferings like an Angel for all that was excellent in Woman was comprised in that form, My beloved Brother too, his youthful head was soon laid where the "Wicked cease from troubling and the weary are at rest" he was only just entering into the world ignorant of its wickedness unacquainted with vice, and so soon to be cut off, oh my dear Cousin these where heavy afflictions, but shall such frail mortals as we are murmur or repine at the Almightys will, it was him that did the deed, and shall we dare to ask his reason, he has wise reasons for all his actions. - I attended my dear Brothers death bed, and never never may I again endure such another trial it was almost too much for my poor heart, to see him I loved so tirelesly, laying in an agony of pain, and not a word of Complaint escape his lips, he bore all his sufferings with the greatest patience and appeared to be perfectly resigned, but when he resigned his breath he appeared to have fallen into a sweet sleep so gentle and without a groan did he leave this world of woe, and then so soon to follow the Death of my departed Sisters Infant, it seemed as though it had only been born to be regretted, so perfect a little Angel it was, but oh was only a blossom. bloomed to fall so soon, its innocent spirit fled this earth and joined its Sainted Mother in realms of perfect bliss. I must not dwell on these Melancholy Subjects any longer for my heart is full. - I am now up in Sydney spending two or three months with my Mother who I am happy to say enjoys very Good health, I came up for the purpose of seeing her, as well as getting an operation performed on Mary Hs Hands for when she was scalded, through neglect they became con-pacted , and I have now had them cut, and I have no doubt it will be an excellent cure. she is very well in her health, indeed we all  expected when they where cut she would be  and be reduced very much but instead of that she is getting  stout, I have now got a little Boy just ten months old, and a remarkably stout Child and very healthy. I can assure you his Papa is not a little proud of him, he does not think there is such another Boy in the World as his, When I last heard from my dear Husband he was quite well and very anxious for my return and I can assure you I am not a little anxious to Embrace him that all my happiness  with, no one can imagine how much I am suffering owing this short absence from my beloved Husband. I feel that this world would be a blank without him, he is a kind and affectionate partner, nay I do not Envy the greatest and the Richest in the world. with such a being as it has been my happiness to be united to, and I hope my dear Cousin when it falls to your lot you will enjoy as much happiness in the Married State as has fallen to my share. Remember me to all Friends that enquire for me, the Cochranes, Mr Grahame, Mr and Mrs Fleming, and when you go to Edinburgh remember me to Miss Duncan, and the Robertsons and the Reochs. I have written to Margaret Reoch this time, when Mr Thomson last heard from Capt Wood he was quite well, We hear from him almost every week, he has built a very fine House, but he still says he wants a Wife, give my kind regards to that Family.  
do not forget to remember me very kindly to your Mary tell her I have not forgot her and never shall, and do not call me selfish when I often say I wish I had so valuable a creature for this is a wretched Country for Servants, I often talk about her and wish I had such a one here. tell her I often often think of her kindly. When you write your Brother and Sister give my love to them and tell your Sister I shall write her as soon as I return home but my mind is so unsettled I cannot at present. I am affraid you will think this a sad scrawl but the ship sails very early in the morning and this must go to my  and Mother has been calling me to make haste for this last half hour, I must therefore conclude and accept of my love and believe me to remain
your affectionate Cousin
Eliza Thomson
