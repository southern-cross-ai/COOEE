Sir,
As might be easily forseen, the excursion of Mr. Bateman across the Straits to Port Phillip, is on the eve of being succeeded by others of similiar description. Mr. Fawkner is nearly ready to start for that place, well supplied with every necessary requisite for a Settler, and in addition to the usual munitions of war, for either attack or defence, such as muskets, bayonets, sabres, etc, etc, he takes out two twelve pounders, and some light field pieces, with which he intends to join Wedgaree, who, in right of his grandmother, derives his title from the elder branch of the Fudge Family, whose cognomen is Fudgaree - Mr. B. deriving his strange title from the junior branch of that family.
Mr. F. takes out a quantity of rum and tobacco, and for an extra bottle of the former, expects to get a much larger grant than Mr. B, as he does not reckon on taking less than five millions of acres, and expects, with his superior means, to drive the rival of Wedgaree out of the field.
It appears from the best authority, that the company of which Mr. B. forms a member, consists of what is termed, the "mistic number" of twelve, irreverantly called the Twelve Apostles, but it is not true "that his Excellency the Governor is one of the twelve," or that he has promised, (as reported) to support their petition to the Colonial Department, for a confirmation of their extraordinary grant, because others might with equal justice, make the same claim, and the mode of obtaining it, looks like an insult to the Sovereignity of the British Government, of which Port Phillip forms a part.
It is reported that Hungaree, son of Bongaree, (seeing the temptation held out by making presents of rum, and tobacco, and creating artificial wants, of which poor ignorant naked savages had no idea) whose father claimed the hunting ground about Sydney, has given Governor Bourke notice, that he will dispossess him, unless he consents to pay yearly tribute in rum and tobacco.
Mr Fawkner intends to go on a more political and humane principle; he will only give a few presents to gain the good will of the natives, but will give them the same right which they now possess over the spontaneous productions of the soil, AND ALL THE OPPOSSUMS, only asking leave to graze some animals, which he will bring into the country, and sow some garnivorous and legneous plants and vegetables.
It is reported, but it cannot be true, that the Sydney blacks are still rationed by the Government of Van Diemen's Land, although sent on a private expedition to Port Phillip, where they are still detained, teaching the natives the use of arms, and a craving for unnecessary wants, which may, at a future period, make them troublesome neighbors to new settlers: and that Captain Pigeon, and his company, are placed on the "Aborigine Establishment", which forms an item in an expenditure, of ONLY Â£1899 per annum.
Port Phillip is not a recent discovery; it is well known for the last twenty years, and so is all the adjoining coast; the natives are poor, naked savages, who bivouac round a fire at the foot of a gum tree, and sleep with their fret to the heat: they have no idea of DISTINCT DISTRICTS or boundaries, they are here to day and gone to morrow, and are the lowest scale of humanity; they cannot for a moment be compared to the Aborigines of America, who attained a wonderful degree of civilization, and have left monuments of the arts behind them, which will descend to the latest posterity; so that a contract made with such people, will not bear the least comparison, nor has the most distant analogy to the one ATTEMPTED to be made with some half dozen roaming savages, placed in the lowest scale of human beings.
