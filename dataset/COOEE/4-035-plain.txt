That is the first thing you have ever written that has really hurt me. I don't feel it from Stewart so much  But that Lillie, my loved Lillie should thus think of me I did not think possible. With reference to what aunt may have said and what you say about one or two inevitable obstacles that cannot be got over you do not say what they are. If you had, I might have been able to answer or remove them. So you had better let me know what insurmountable difficulties are and if they are really such I must take other measures to make you a home. You see it just comes to this. I am in this for seven years, I may make a good thing out of it by that time. If I leave sooner I have no money to start myself as you know well. If things go on as they are I would feel free to marry soon. If you cannot live up here why I will not stay up here seven years to live a lonely hermit's life and perhaps at the end of that time be delayed again through my not getting something else to do at once. It just comes to this: if the difficulty is considered insurmountable by aunt I will give up this place at once and go and try my hand at something else and either come back and claim for you for my bride in 3 or 4 years time with enough to settle down in comfort, or if I find that I am one of fortune's fools I will not ask you to bind yourself to one who may selfishly keep you bound to him and after having thus held out hope to you year after year, perhaps never be in a position to marry you and the best portion of your life gone. I shall think no more on this subject until I get your letter in reply then I shall take steps accordingly.
