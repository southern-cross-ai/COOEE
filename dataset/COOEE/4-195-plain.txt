 to sluggishness of the liver caused by eating meat during the hot weather. Meat is an article of food that is on the Australian table at every meal. And it seems to me the longer you are in the country the fonder you get of meat and most people never think the table properly furnished unless there is meat. However I restrict myself to eating it twice a day, breakfast and dinner, my third meal being generally bread and treacle and I find the treacle acts as a medicine and prevents any lodgement of bile.  Although in Gippsland a land that might be said to be flowing with milk and honey, it is impossible to procure, for either love or money, a bit of butter and as I did not get any cows as I purposed on account of not having any land fenced in and it would have been great trouble to keep a cow in the open bush. As it is now in the middle of winter it would not be advisable to buy. We have an 80 acre paddock fenced in and expect to have the other 270 acres fencing by spring. Then we intend putting on a few head of young stock as many as there will be money to buy. 
I have about two acres with the timber grubbed, that is the trees are stripped at the roots of the earth and the roots are cut and thus the tree falls uprooted all save the very ends of the roots which are afterwards followed along as far as is necessary and cut out so as the plough or spade will not strike against them. 
I find the soil around my hut very productive (in fact all the block in James name and about the half of a block in my name is all very much alike with a rich black soil on the surface of a gritty clay subsoil) I having now proof of it in the shape of turnips cabbages and cauliflowers and vegetable marrows. There are cabbages as big as my head grown without manure. When one compared this land with yours under the terms which they are held it seems a marvel that there is not even a greater amount emigration from the old country. 
Undoubtedly a young farmer starting on a piece of new land has a great many inconveniences to contend with but there is one grand thing about it: the land is becoming your own and there will be no landlord craving you for the rent. 
I am now over helping Mr. Wilson with his sheep. They are now lambing and we have had great trouble guarding them every night on account of the dingoes which has killed no less than 14 or 15. They are a great pest to sheep owners
