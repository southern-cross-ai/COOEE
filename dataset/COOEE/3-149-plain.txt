In the period from the commencement of April to the end of October rain fell on fifty-eight days, but violent showers visited us only fifteen times; on all the other occasions the amount of water deposited on the earth was very trifling. During May, June, and July frequent frosts occurred, generally attended by heavy fogs; the coldest day of the season was the 5th July, when there was much ice seen, and the thermometer at daylight stood at 33.
I believe it is universally admitted that there has been a decrease in the number of cattle in this district since the end of last summer, and that it is owing to the large number of fat cattle taken to market, and to the fact of few of the overlanders delivering as much as 50 per cent. of the store, cattle with which they originally started from the north. Breeding has now quite passed out of fashion, and all deficiencies have consequently to be made up with cattle brought from a distance. Calves have been suffering from some sort of disease in the lungs, which not only appears to give them great pain, but also prevents them from fattening. Sheep are getting fewer and fewer; and, although many persons are talking of putting sheep on their runs, as yet I do not hear of the arrival of any flocks. Of the late clip, part went to Melbourne by drays, and the remainder goes to the same place by the steam-boats, via Lake Alexandrina.  But few horses have been disposed of, but it is expected that, if the new method of breaking-in these animals is found successful with buck-jumpers, a considerable number of horses, hitherto almost useless, will be rendered manageable, and sent to market.
It is noticeable that this part of the colony is now more valuable than when first taken up, as the constant presence of cattle and sheep, and more particularly of the latter, has had the effect of causing many places - formerly quite barren, to become well grassed.
The navigation of the river by five steamboats has given much pleasure to all the settlers along its banks, and hopes are entertained that better days are in store for this part of the colony than it has ever yet witnessed.
The fine fresh of water down the channel of the Lachlan, and the late rains, have had the effect of recovering the Lachlan district from the distress which it suffered in the commencement of the season from the want of water, and great deficiency of feed. Grass just now is tolerably plentiful, and the stock are fast recovering from the extreme state of leanness to which the barrenness of the plains have reduced them.
This part of the Darling district is daily coming more into notice, and it is hardly going too far to say that within a short time the Lower Darling will be quite as valuable as the Lower Murrumbidgee is at the present day. During the winter many runs have been stocked for the first time, and it has been found that certain parts are particularly favourable for the grazing of sheep. Some cattle fattened on the Darling, and lately sent to Melbourne, were especially commended for the fineness of their condition and the firmness of their flesh. The river is constantly patrolled by native police, so that the aborigines no longer have the opportunity of molesting the settlers; in fact, the majority of the shepherds now employed are black men, who are found to be a much more useful set of men than the aborigines ever were in the Murrumbidgee district.
Why promise and not perform is a questions that the inhabitants of this locality wish to put to Bishop Barker, because for more than three years past he has promised to send us a minister, and as late as 17th May last stated, at a public meeting in Sydney, that clergymen were shortly to be appointed to the Lachlan, the Lower Murrumbidgee, and Moulamein, and yet up to the present moment we have seen nothing of the coming men. It may here be stated that there is urgent need for two or three clergymen and plenty of work for them to do, funds forthcoming for their support, and in this district, very probably, money for building a chapel at Lang's Crossing Place as soon as ever there may be any want of such an erection. The way in which Sunday is usually spent in these parts is far from being conducive to the promotion of morality, and nothing but the presence amongst us of faithful ministers will ever have any effect in counteracting such proceedings.  All true friends of the Church of England must greatly regret the apathy that has been shown in the important work of obtaining additional clergymen, for the large amount of work long waiting to be done in the unsettled districts.
Although no special diseases have prevailed, there have been great complaints during the winter of a considerable amount of general illness, for which the weather and the unusual deficiency of electricity in the air, have justly or unjustly been accused of being the cause. Diarrhoea has been a somewhat frequent visitor, and ophthalmic diseases have continued to be very prevalent.
New and improved huts, with glass windows, wooden floors, lined walls, and many necessary comforts, formerly but rarely seen in the bush, appear to be now the order of the day, as well as large size stock-yards, with draughting gates and other conveniences for the easy working of cattle. Very large paddocks, enclosing considerable tracts of country, have also been erected in many localities. The work of fencing in runs is also still being carried on, on a large scale, and much attention is directed to damming creeks so as to keep, if not a permanent, at least a partial supply of water during the commencement of the summer.
Much more attention is also now being paid here to the cultivation of garden ground, and it is now found that by putting in the seed at the commencement of the autumn, fine crops of early vegetables may be raised. The want of cabbage, since the ravages of the aphis brassica destroyed the crops, has been partially supplied by the use of milk thistles, which, when boiled, are very good, and nearly similar in flavour to spinach. The young leaves of the salt bush have also been used, and when eaten, with the addition of a little vinegar, are not found to be altogether unpalatable. It has been proved by trial that the pink coloured pulpy fruit of the pig-face (mesembryanthemum) may be converted into very good jelly or jam.
The amount of labour lately present in this district has been far from equal to the demand - in fact, during the whole time of shearing there was a deficiency of men. There has been a demand for hutkeepers, cooks, and milkmen, which has not been supplied. Many families have been brought out, and are still arriving from England, under special engagements for employment in the bush. Such persons seem generally to be found more serviceable than others who have had long colonial experience. Really good servants still command high wages, but the remuneration paid to middling and inexperienced persons is somewhat lower than formerly. The present average rates are: Stockmen, £60 to £80; shepherds, £40 to £45; man and wife on station, £75 to £85; milkmen, £60, all by the year; hutkeepers, 15s. to 25s.; tailors, 15s.; labourers, 15s. to 20s., all by the week.
