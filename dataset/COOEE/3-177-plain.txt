I was delighted to hear her end was a happy one, it is the only comfort left for those behind, we could not wish her back again to this world of sin and misery. I hope your dear Mama has been Given Grace to bear it with Christian Pacience. I have no doubt that she will be suported under all Knothing  will be put on her more than she will be able to bare. It is har to part bu we must expect it some day or other, as we know the lot of all men is to die. I trust dear Edward when our time comes I hope we shall have our lamps trimed prepared to meet our Savour. 
Dear Edward give my kind love to your dear Mama. I hope by this time She has quite recovered. Is the Buisness left to her, or is it a Partnership affair I shoul so like to know. I hope, all your Grand Mothers affairs were left square and that your Mama will have no truble but I hope to get on well. I have written 3 letters for the one you wrote. I hope she has received them for I sent a Gold Pin which I should not like to be lost and all the newse which you ar ancious to he I expect.

His Sister is living with us. She goes in to buisness with her Brother ever morning and returns in the evening. She is a dear Sister to me. I shoul not know what to do without her. She is so kind and good. You shoul see us just now. We ar all writing to old Ireland round the table and a comfortable little fire in a comfortable little Cottage, in fact it is a perfect little Picture of happiness.  I only wish you could transfer your self for a Month and then you could answer for yourself.
