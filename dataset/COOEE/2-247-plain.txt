Apsley Station, Wellington, 1 May 1841. 
Reverend Sir
I have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of 20 January 1840. It is not convenient for me at present (having to form a new mission establishment to provide for thirty natives) to enter into the particulars of your letter. This I shall do at a future time. A gentleman of this neighbourhood being on his way to Sydney, I avail myself of the opportunity of forwarding the accompanying reply which has been too long delayed. 
I am 
Reverend Sir 
Your obedient servant
William Watson.
