My dear Madam
We had the pleasure to receive your kind remembrances for me & mine. We are always happy to hear of or from you. The Ink-stand I shall much esteem, as it keeps me in mind of many pleasing circumstances that are past. I was much rejoiced to hear from you respecting your dear departed Companion and trust that your long fervent & ardent prayers were heard for him. I find that by every vessel my old friends are dropping off and that I am likely to be left alone on earth. I think little of Common acquaintance, but much where the friendship has been long and sincere. Our best Friend will not die, he remains unchangeable and to him we may at all times apply for comfort in the day of trouble. I am happy to say we are all pretty well through the Divine Mercy. I have had my vexations in this reign but it will soon be over now.  What the next will be I know not but the spirit of the will will continue to be enmity to God and godliness and therefore I think things will be probably nearly the same to the end of life. The Lord is good and kind and gracious, and I have obtained one object that was much upon my mind by my returning, the establishment of a Mission at New Zealand. This is a great work and I trust will be attended by the Divine blessing. It has gone on well hitherto and I have only to regret the death of that great man Duaterra in whom I had placed much confidence as to managing the Mission in New Zealand but in this respect my hopes arc now- blasted. Probably you will see some account of his death in the Missionary Register as I sent it to the Secretary. I should he happy to spend my remaining days in New Zealand could I do this with propriety but many ties secure my stay here at present, though my life is a continuous warfare, and I have fighting without and fears within.
We have some very profane and wicked men here in power and it is impossible either to conciliate their favor or to avoid the shafts of their hatred. I know that some of my friends in England will not always approve of my public conduct but they can neither enter into my feelings nor comprehend the reasons for my actions.
I have felt myself agrieved and have appealed unto Caesar again and again. Men in power like Religion so far as it agrees with their political measures and tends to support their dignity and consequence but no further. Ahab will never die so long as there is an Elijah on Earth, and Elijah will always be considered as one of the troubles of Israel. I shall refer to the Revd. Mr. Vales for further information respecting the Colony. Mr. Vales is now-before a general Court-Martial & no doubt will return to Europe.
I do not approve of the matter that led to his arrest and trial but the higher powers must settle this, it rests between the Governor and him. Few clergymen are fit for the Colony. It is a very extraordinary place and requires much solid prudence piety and much common sense to do anything with the inhabitants.  I mean the whole body those in and those out of power.
I mentioned to you in a former letter that Mr. Vale would not answer, he is not at all suited to this Colony though possessed of ability. In the present difference between Mr. Vale & the Governor I think they are both much in the wrong, the former as a Clergyman and the latter as a Governor but this time will determine. I should be sorry to do anything by which the Ministry would be blamed. I am glad Mr. Youle has arrived as he will be a useful man where he is going. There has been no Minister in that settlement since it was established more than 10 Years ago and he is a quiet prudent man though not equal to the situation of a clergyman at Port Jackson. I wish you knew of a person whom you could recommend to come out, I am much in want of assistance. I am happy to say the Schools are going on well, I do not think there is any portion of the globe where the Common people's children are so well instructed as they are here and I feel much pleasure in seeing the young men of the Colony though horn of the most depraved parents, in general sober honest and industrious and many of the poor Orphan Girls who were received into the Home married well, and become respectable mothers and members of Society. This is a very gratifying sight to me.
In about six months I hope to open a large new building at Parramatta which will contain about 200 girls as an Orphan House and then the benefits will be more extensive. I now want to see a House built for the accommodation of female convicts where they can be comfortably lodged and usefully employed.
When in England I urged this object very strongly upon his grace the Archbishop and upon his Majesty's Ministers but it is not done yet. I have also remonstrated with our present Governor upon the subject but as yet nothing has been done. I have made another application to Lord Bathurst and if I cannot obtain the necessary buildings for these poor exiles (those objects of vice and woe).  I have determined to lay their situation before the British Nation and then I am sure it will be done.
You will have heard of my visit to New Zealand and the reception I met with there. I shall try to send your son a little Iron Stone, or anything of that nature I can procure as soon as I can. A Captain Brahyn who now returns to England and will shortly come out again to New South Wales may probably give you a Call. He is an old acquaintance of mine, though not a pious man we have served many years together. He will bring out a letter from you should you find it convenient, to write. Mrs. Marsden, my daughters, and Charles feel grateful to you for your kindness and beg to be remembered most affectionately to you and yours. Give my Christian regards to Mr. and Mrs. Hughes and Mr. Stokes
And believe me
Dear Madam
Yours in the bond of
Christian Love
SAML. MARSDEN.
