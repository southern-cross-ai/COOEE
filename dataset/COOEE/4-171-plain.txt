 Indeed I would not advise you. It was the sorest trial ever I came across leaving them both in their old age when they both need my help most. But if God so wills it that we do not meet on this earth but on that land beyond not made with hands immortal in the heavens, but I trust they may both be spared and have long and happy days.
