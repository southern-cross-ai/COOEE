Dear Mother and Father,
This comes with my kind love to you, hoping to find you in good health as, thank God, it leaves me at present very comfortable indeed. I have a place at a farm-house, and I have got a good master, which I am a great deal more comfortable than I expected. I works the same as I were at home; I have plenty to eat and drink, thank God for it. I am allowed two ounces of tea, one pound of sugar, 12 pounds of meat, 10 pounds and a half of flour, two ounces of tobacco, the week; three pair of shoes, two suits of clothes, four shirts, a year; that is the allowance from Government. But we have as much to eat as we like, as some masters are a great deal better than others. All a man has got to mind is to keep a still tongue in his head, and do his master's duty, and then he is looked upon as if he were at home; but if he don't he may as well be hung at once, for they would take you to the magistrates and get 100 of lashes, and then get sent to a place called Port Arthur to work in irons for two or three years, and then he is disliked by everyone I hope you will study these few lines which I have wrote to you, my dear mother and father, brothers and sisters and all my friends belonging to me in that country; this country is far before England in everything, both for work and money. Of a night, after I have done my work, I have a chance to make a few shillings; I can go out hunting or shooting of kangaroo, that is about the size of a sheep, or ducks or swans, tigers, tiger-cats or native cats; there is nothing that will hurt a man but a snake, they are about five or six feet long, but they will get away if they can. I have dogs and a gun of my own, thank God for it, to make me a few shillings, anything that I want; thank God, I am away from all beer-shops, there is ne'er a one within 20 miles of where I live.  I have a fellow-prisoner living with me, which he is a shoemaker, and he is learning me to make shoes, which will be a great help to me; in about two years I shall be able to make a pair of shoes myself; then, thank God for it, I am doing a great deal better than ever I was at home, only for the wanting you with me, that is all my uncomfortableness is in being away from you. Dear father and mother, I hope you will understand it what I have wrote to you in this letter, as it gave me much pleasure in writing it, and always will, let me be where - Dear mother and father I have eight years to serve with my master, and then I shall have a ticket of  relief, that is to work for myself, and then to keep that for four years if no trouble, and to have my emancipation, that is to be a free man in this country; I am now a prisoner then in this place, and then after that I shall have my free pardon to come to England once more. But I should be a deal more comfortable if you could get the parish to send you out, as it would be the making of you if they would pay your passage over, and give you about £60 to land with, you would do well. A farming man gets 5s. a day at day-work; if you was to come you could take me of Government for £1 for eight years to work for you, and then we should be more comfortable than ever we have been, as I am a prisoner; so I hope you will do your best endeavour to come to this country as it is far before England. Dear mother and father, I had a most beautiful passage over, thank God for it; we sailed on the 13th November from Spithead, and we landed on the 7th March. From England to Van Diemen's Land is 17,000 miles. Dear mother and father, I hope you will answer this letter as soon as possible, and I hope you will send me the particulars about everything at home. Dear brothers and sisters, I hope that you will never give your poor mother and father so much trouble as I have. Dear mother and father, I hope you don't fret about me, as I am a doing well at present; thank God, I don't want for anything but to see you, my dears; so God bless you all for ever. Please to send me word how to farm hops from the beginning to the ending; but mind, father, it is winter here when it is summer at home, and when you have day we have night; and you must be sure to pay the water carriage for the letter you send me, which is about 8d.; and I have made enquiries for Henry Hart and the Newmans from Uckfield, and cannot hear anything of them. So no more at the present from your loving, though unfortunate,
Henry Tingley.
Dear father, when you write to me, you must direct for me at Mr. Lyne's, Apsley Lagoon, Molter's Bay, Great Swan Port, Van Diemen's Land.
