Mission House, Wellington Valley, 6 Nov 1837.
My Dear Sir
I received your letter of the 16th March 1837 but do not consider myself at present fully prepared to reply to those very serious charges implied therein. As by the time we shall receive an answer to this we shall have been seven years from England, and as two applications have been made to the Corr. Comm. for leave of absence for the benefit of our health without obtaining their permission, I have now to request that the Parent Comm. will allow us to visit England for the benefit of our worn out constitution. 
I am 
My Dear Sir 
Yours faithfully
William Watson.
