On the 39th anniversary of the foundation of the Colony (Jany. 26th) a Public Meeting of all the free inhabitants of N.S. Wales was convened by the Sheriff for the purpose of petitioning the King and both Houses of Parliament, that Trial by Jury, and a House of Assembly be allowed in this Colony; the meeting was numerously and respectably attended, "The Hero of Australia" (one of her sons) spoke at great length, and as a test that this speech was the voice of the popular feeling, "The loud cheers and great applause" which it excited bears ample testimony, as well as that those who are opposed to an application for these indulgences, were inexcusably absentees: fully aware, I imagine, that all they could advance would not gain one proselyte in that Assembly - I believe that nothing is more likely to promote Emigration to this Colony than being in possession of all the rights of British subjects. "Trial by Jury" first and foremost for which we are every year becoming more competent, and secondly "Taxation by Representation" which we may now with some face hope for, when it is known that our Colonial Revenue amounts to £65,000 annually which by a late calculation appears to be a Tax of £3 per head for every free adult in the Colony.

This place  which 10 or 12 years ago was a quiet country looking, thoroughly English looking Town, is now a crowded Bustling Business like City - the shops are well supplied generally speaking, and the price of Leghorn Bonnets are very high nothing wearable at less than six guineas! The price of Tea is very low - good black Tea being only about one shilling per pound by the chest.

It might be thought that Governor Darling is trying how unpopular he can make himself - his late measure is a rash one to say nothing more of it, and he has placed a man of narrow mind, repulsive manners, and a selfish disposition, in the situation lately filled by a Gentleman every way the reverse of this character, a situation too, where conciliatory manners, and an obliging disposition is so necessary - everybody will feel the reverse, and the change is terrible loss to the Colony.

An Act in Council passed on 3rd inst. entitled "an act for imposing a Duty upon all Newspaper and Papers of a like nature" has caused a great sensation in Sydney - this will indeed act as "a restriction on the Press". I wish I could say such a restriction was uncalled for, and unnecessary, but we are too young a Country to be allowed all the privileges of a British people - Sir Thomas Brisbane allowed to this Colony the full liberty of the Press. General Darling has passed more than one act for the restriction of this liberty, and has thus rendered himself if possible more unpopular than heretofore. It is a pity his measures and his manners are not more conciliatory, for I believe him to be a well intentioned Governor, and I have no doubt the experience of seven years will render him far more agreeable to the inhabitants of N.S.W. during the last years of his Administration: for "be it Recorded" I think the administration will extend to twelve years.
