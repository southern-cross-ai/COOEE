My Dear Cousin,
You will excuse me not answering your letter of the 2nd feby as I have been so taken up with business, their has been a ship calld the Tuscan arrivd from Sydney lately which I got letter by from my family and which I had a difficulty in finding them out as the Come in a private box so that it took me nearly Three days before I could get them, you may think my anxiety. however I got very pleasant news they were all very well and happy and has they say they happiness whould be Complete if I near them, I have on this day been on board the Brixton laying in the London Docks with a friend of mine to agree about my passage out but the Captain was not on board therefore I have not yet agreed but I shall tomorrow as the accomadation seems very good. she is expected to sail in a month from this date which you see I Shall not have much time to spare. I wrote my daughters on the 10th so I expect an answer by friday next - they had a wish to stay another three months but that they will not be able. but they shall stop their till I go which giving them time to come up to London will be three weeks or a month more as perhaps the ship may not sail by a week so soon as expected but they was to sail the 28th this month. I will thank you to purchase me about 200 yards of different pattern plaids from Kilmarnock, 50 yards of each pattern. let them be good and as Cheap as you can that I know I have no occasion to warn you of and let their be attached to each pattern the Clan they are of, you will know how to send them to me better than I can tell you, direct for me at Mr Jones 53 old broad street, and Draw for the amount on him - I should like you when my daughters are Comeing of for London if you had any Business in Eding to see them of in the best smack their and has comfottable as possible but I should not wish you to go over on purpose / as Mr Nash I daresay will be kind enough on your account to do that you may let Capt Wood know of this Conveyance. perhaps he might avail himself of it. Cabin passenger 80 guineas Steerage 40 ditto and Mr Scott, he wished me to say what may be good to send out their. I really cannot tell him now as the place is so glutted with goods I shall not take out myself anything like what I intended / they asked me 30 pounds to take out the Carriage I have not yet agreed with them to do so has I think it too much Your letter of advice came too late about the Houses as I sold them for Â£300, when I left Manchester I desired John to write you which I suppose he did / I am now so busy in making my purchases and London is so large a place it takes me nearly all day to walk from one place to another - I was very proud to hear your account of my daughters being so very well in health. I can assure you it added to my recovery, I am extremely obbliged to you for the attention you have paid to them on every occasion, and the Interest you have taken in procuring me letters of introduction to the Commissarys brothers but I have not yet read them, Mr Thomas Brishan is expected in London every day, I should like if you could procure me amongst your friends a letter or two of introduction to him. I understand he does not expect to sail from Greenock as the owners of the ship he wished to go in and he disagreed. You was kind enough to say you whould send me a few apples for which I was much obbliged but I was obliged to leave for London - you may tell Mr Scott that Irish Linins, hucaback lining silk Books of different kinds, Morsellas super fine broad Cloth & black nails of different sorts and Steel Cutting and (shoes womens) and sundry other articles which I cannot enumerate these are such as I should take out but it is intirely a risk now as their is such an abundance gone out their. their has been a very fine track of Land lately discovd by Mr Throsby the person you may recolect that found the last Track out some hundreds of Thousands acres without a tree and very rich land / it is supposed it will be fine Country I cannot be as explanitory as I whould wish now Has I have a friend waiting to go out with me now, but I hope you will course, you have an opportunity of letting my daughters know of any part of this letter you may think is nessery - give my respects to all Inquireing friends I am afraid you will hardly make this out but I know you will excuse my Errors I hope Mary is well  
I am my dear Cousin yours affectionately
