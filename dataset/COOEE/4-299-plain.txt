At the same time I will be careful only to advance such money in case it should be absolutely necessary to carry through the necessary improvements thereby conserving your interest in the block for as you have a sum of money against the block it is necessary in your interest that the improvements should be made complete so that the land may be worth some rent for grazing. 
As far as I am concerned I will render him any assistance that may be in my power and as I know the rape a bit my advice may come in useful. There is some further work to do on our own front block and of course I will give it to him to do so that he may have some ready cash. The use of the garden he will also have free for keeping it in order. 
I am glad to say that I have at last got the half year's rent which was due in February but it was only yesterday that I received a post office order for the amount. 
I hope to have a better man to take the paddock next term. The letting has not been taken out of the hands of ML Wilson therefore he has a perfect right to the commission and as it is only 2 1/2% I consider he earns it. 
James has moved to his new home in Bendigo. trade is keeping up very well with him considering the dull state of the times  
PS The Lands Department have passed my block as satisfactory. The improvements on it now amount to Â£228 odd.
