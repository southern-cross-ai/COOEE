Worthy of marvel are both. But one who does not happen to have the habits of abstraction of a philosopher, and a German philosopher to boot, finds often enough something as wonderful in its way. Kant, it may be presumed, had perhaps never seen - certainly never felt - an attorney. Metaphysician as he was, and casuist, to him a lawyer's conscience was a thing unknown. And he lived and died there in Konigsberg without dreaming of a phenomenon connected with the municipal law far transcending and laughing at all moral law within or without, - an attorney's impudence. To him who pretended to map the mind of man, there was a terra Australis incognita requisite for the completion of his gigantic surveys. The critic of the pure reason never dreamed of such a moral and intellectual impossibility as Mr. William Whaley Billyard. 
Once upon a time, the British Colonial administration, with that learned sagacity which has always marked its proceedings, determined to establish a new settlement on the northern coast of Australia. Of course the most important part of the affair, and therefore what the authorities "at home" understood best, was the duty of making the appointments. A governor was necessary, and so was a judge. In those days, perhaps, "the Bar" was not such a drug in the English market as to make the exportation of Holyoake Bayleys a profitable speculation; but, at all events, an attorney was chosen for the North Australian ermine. Doubtless Her Majesty's Government expected "a good stroke" in land in the new colony. For the judge was neither nisi prius nor a criminal lawyer. His sole qualification was that he had been a pupil of the learned Jarman and if he had no claims to what Mr. W. B. Dalley would term "lots of law," he was a proficient in the law of "lots." This judge was Mr. William. Whaley Billyard. He arrived at Port Curtis in an age of iron realities, preceding the bell éta dell' ora of Rockhampton and Canoona. He never ascended the Bench, for the unhappy fortunes of the settlement never permitted it to furnish board, much less a bench for the learned gentleman's use. He arrived in Sydney, carrying with him, as his capital for investment in the community, his claims upon the Imperial Government. In those historic days, such claims were like claims upon Mr. Cowper recently, of far safer and more solid nature than property similarly named in auriferous regions. Mr. Whaley Billyard's claim furnished an astonishing yield. After doing a little journeyman jobbing for the profession, a particular breeze, which carried off a Mr. Cooper Turner from some of his creditors, was the ill wind that blew Mr. Whaley Billyard good. Mr. Billyard was made Her Majesty's Crown Solicitor for Civil Business. We ourselves, and we are told various honourable members of the Legislature at those searching eras when the estimates have come on for consideration, have found a fruitful subject for marvel in the necessity for a Civil Crown Solicitor at all. What the particular civil business is of the Crown Law Department demanding the presence of a solicitor, or, at all events, anything more than that of an expert clerk, we never could divine; nor have, we believe, the public at large yet learnt. That the Crown required a solicitor to do its business is obvious enough; and equally obvious, to anybody who understands such matters, that one solicitor would suffice for all the business the Crown has to do. With the exception of preparing bonds of sureties and similarly simple documents in connection with the public service, of certifying as to the right of parties to receive grants of land, and some other small matters, during the days of Mr. Whaley Billyard's salary and Mr. Whaley Billyard's perquisites, it is hard to see what a Civil Crown Solicitor had to do. An action brought by the Government was what that quotation in the Eton Latin grammar from the poet of an age of similes, prior to the investigation of our own interesting ornithology, calls a rara avis. The whole legal transactions of the Railway Commissioners, after even railway management had become a public department, were conducted by an eminent legal firm in this city, Messrs. Norton, Son, and Barker, at an expense to the public of about one thousand pounds per annum. And meantime, the actual, the positive law required by the Government, that for which an attorney charges you, interesting and interested reader, six and eightpences and thirteen and fourpences, was furnished altogether by the Attorney- and Solicitor-General. Mr. Whaley Billyard had, in point of fact, as a public officer, nothing to do. All that the Civil Crown Solicitor might have been asked to perform, besides signing his name, was done by a clerk, - a respectable person, by name Mr. Jackson, and who, except that high necessities of State prevented it, might have discharged his laudable functions for years past as clerk to a Crown Solicitor for All Business, as well as to a Crown Solicitor for Civil Business. Such was what persons in practice in the Courts of Equity call, we believe, "the state of facts."  Mr. Whaley Billyard, fully as he recognised the propriety of persons of abilities and "claims" like his own being salaried, with a view of preserving that hold on social respectability which, let Mr. Rotten and Mr. Daniel Egan talk as they like, is a prime necessity of Government, had energies and activities, the whole of his time, and office accommodation for a considerable period in one of Her Majesty's buildings, to spare. Mr. Billyard, therefore, went to work, and, to his honour be it said, founded and conducted a very large and lucrative private practice. But the extraordinary energies and powers of the learned gentleman had space and time for still further operations. He became an agent on a majestic scale for some of our absentee landlords, and to an impressive extent an "attorney," in the vicarious and not the professional sense, for money lenders in the British Isles. This was "pretty good," as an accomplished Scottish friend of ours is wont to put things with emphatic idiom. But "panting Time," to use a complimentary poet's line about Shakespeare, " toiled after" Mr. Whaley Billyard "in vain." 
On the demise of a partner in a well-known firm in the city, still retaining his multiform duties, Mr. Billyard, as locum tenens, took charge of perhaps the most extensive legal business in New South Wales. 
The Civil Crown Solicitor's department, we may remark by way of culmination, went on swimmingly the while. And though Government, when it required the presence of a solicitor to guard its interests in the inferior courts, was specially compelled from time to time to retain Mr. Williarn Roberts, or some other advocate practising at the Police Office bar, at outlays of from ten to twenty guineas, the veriest tyro in the practice of the law will see that could flow from nothing defective in the purely solicitorial arrangements of the Crown business. And Mr. Whaley Billyard, a man of small proportions, being raised to the pedestal of the Civil Crown Solicitorship before the public gaze, which, as in the cases of men of similar merit, might otherwise have missed him, made his fortune. 
But the most interesting portion of Mr. Whaley Billyard's nature, his conscience, had not yet come publicly into play. Hitherto it was operating apart, in tender shadow, "all there," as the popular phrase is, but by no means exhibiting or seeming disposed to exhibit before the public eye those remarkable proportions and qualities which have made us deem it a duty to render it, as far as our humble means will permit, historical. In the course of the present year, the Government, under the frequent remonstrances of the Assembly, abolished Mr. Whaley Billyard's functions as distinctive ones, and consolidated the offices of the Civil and Criminal Crown Solicitor into one. The new Crown Solicitor was to devote himself entirely to the public service, and to receive the handsome salary of £1,000 per annum. The office on the new conditions was tendered to Mr. Billyard, who refused it. Indeed, the thing, to a gentleman in his circumstances and with his views of the duties, was, in point of fact, nothing short of an insult. To the Criminal Crown Solicitor, originally, we are informed, a nominee of Mr. Plunkett's, though as far as right and courtesy went as fully entitled as his colleague in the department, Mr. Cowper was pleased to refrain from making the offer. But Mr. Whaley Billyard, with a sagacity and prevision in themselves evidences of his high professional fitness, was prepared and armed for such a conjuncture. Shortly after the learned gentleman's appointment, he had applied, paid for, and secured from the proper office in London a patent, transforming him, through a colonially appointed functionary, to his own satisfaction, into an Imperial officer. The thing has the highest order of beauty about it that matters of the kind are susceptible of. And to pantomime constructors of the theatres in want of unlooked-for transformations likely "to pay," we recommend it as a study unparalleled in the range of "Colonial experience." "Mr. Billyard," quoth the honourable the First Secretary, on one of those golden Australian mornings, to the little gentleman who, having made his "pile," could afford to listen to a Prime Minister with a smile of philosophic irony, "we shall no longer require your services." "Very good," said Mr. Whaley Billyard; "but there is a little matter of compensation for the abolition of my office I shall expect." "Compensation echoed the honourable gentleman. "Why, you can no more demand compensation than Mr. Moore Dillon; you are both officers appointed in the Colony - " "True," replied the retiring guardian of the Crown's civil litigations, "but Mr. Dillon didn't take care to secure an Imperial patent of office as I did." Whatever be the grounds for this colloquy, as an historical fact, Mr. Whaley Billyard, shortly after the abolition of his office, presented a memorial to his Excellency the Governor-General, praying that an allowance might be made him, on the grounds of the abolition for purely political reasons of his patent office, of some two thousand pounds, or a sum of two hundred per annum. A printed copy of this petition, remarkable for typographical beauty, lies before us. 
Considering "the unique nature" of the memorialist's case, as the document sets it forth, the mythical character of the main services for which the public money was paid yearly to Mr. Whaley Billyard, the fact that for the more tangible portion of his work he was remunerated by individuals in the shape of perquisite fees, and that if compensation be at all due in the case it is eminently owing to the public, not only for what it paid Mr. Whaley Billyard for very small palpable returns, but for what it helped him to, we wish to rescue it from an oblivion it might have fallen into, as the most memorable manifestation of the legal conscience that has yet been seen in this hemisphere, - a monumentum vere perennius of that conscience, we should say, drawing upon the few stock phrases of schoolboy Latinity that still float in our memory, if brass itself were not the very material out of which the whole thing is fashioned, brass of more Corinthian quality than the Greeks, who had no "lower branch of the profession," and never reached that point at which a nation needs Civil Crown Solicitors, even dreamt of.
