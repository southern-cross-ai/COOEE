 since the last time I wrote home we have had uncommonly wet weather. The roads in this district are like ploughed fields. There is no gravel within 40 miles or more of here. Therefore the roads are merely beaten tracks fenced in. They do very well in our dry climate in the summer time and dry weather but when we get much rain like what we have had the last 4 weeks the are almost impassable. 
 on Wednesday evening next there is to be a social ball in connection with the Half-Holiday Association. It is expected to be a very nice turnout. All the shop people who are interested in the half-holiday movement turn out to it, besides a great many of the general public. Of course there are any amount of nice young ladies in Echuca so one has not much difficulty in getting a partner. Echuca is very dull without something of this sort to enliven it up. 
we have great illuminations here on Jubilee week. There was a bullock and three sheep roasted whole in the park and the meat was divided among poor people.
