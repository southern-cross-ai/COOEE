Besides the criminal and quasi-criminal jurisdiction conferred upon Justices of the Peace, the acceptance of the office imposes upon them the responsibility of acting when called upon as members of Local Courts. Justices are liable to a fine of £5 by the SM. then present for non-attendance at the court when summoned to sit.
These are courts established throughout the province somewhat on the principle of the County Courts in England, having for their object the speedy and inexpensive settlement of all personal actions, in respect both of contracts and wrongs where the amounts claimed do not exceed £100. Except as an Appeal Court from summary orders of justices, Local Courts have now no criminal jurisdiction, those sections of the Act which gave a direct criminal jurisdiction as a court of first instance, having been repealed by Act No. 8 of 1869-70.
Local Courts have also power to try causes of interpleader, replevin, and ejectment, where the property or lands are within certain values, and may also entertain demands within the amounts for which they have jurisdiction for the unliquidated balance of partnership account, or for the amount of a distributive share under an intestacy, or of a legacy.
As regards the principles which are to guide the Local Courts in administering justice, the Act (section 13) prescribes that all causes and matters are "to be determined according to equity and good conscience and the substantial merits of the case". These words seem to give to Local Courts that equitable jurisdiction in respect of all matters under its cognizance which enables it to temper the rigour of strict technical law in favour of a litigant who in equity has the substantial merits in his favour. The language of this section is derived from the Imperial Acts constituting Courts of Requests, or Courts of Conscience, as they were also termed. These were Small Debts Courts in the cities and counties of England, and were regulated by 23 Geo. Ill c. 38. They were required to give judgment "according to equity and good conscience and according to the usual course of proceedings at common law" - language by no means so strong as that used in the Local Courts Act. The Superior Courts at Westminster constantly refused to entertain jurisdiction over the judgments of these courts of conscience, holding that the "equity and good conscience" clause precluded them as a Court of Common Law from interfering. The Supreme Court also declines to interfere with the judgments of Local Courts below the appealable amount. (Phillips v. Bennett, Pelham's S.A. Reports, p. 75.)
In causes below £30 the Local Courts are after judgment in the position of the Court of Requests, i.e., no appeal lies to the Supreme Court from their judgment. Before judgment all causes are removable by writ of certiorari if a Judge of the Supreme Court sees fit; and since the fusion in the administration of law and equity in the Supreme Court it would seem that the objection to the interference by certiorari of the Supreme Court with the equitable jurisdiction of the Local Court would not be tenable.
In the court of full jurisdiction, when presided over by a Special Magistrate and two justices, the latter are placed as judges in all respects on an equality with the Special Magistrate. They are at liberty, on the hearing, to examine witnesses, to express their opinion openly in court, both on the facts and the law. They may, together or singly, dissent from the opinion of the Special Magistrate on the facts or the law, and they may together overrule the Special Magistrate, both on the law and the merits.  With one or two exceptions, however, a justice has alone no jurisdiction, either judicial or ministerial, in matters relating to Local Courts, but must exercise that jurisdiction in company with others.
