It was a subject outside the Employers' Union, but during times of depression it behoved every man to find possible ways of escape. There appeared to be a unanimous feeling in favor of adopting a customs union between the colonies, and in regard to this particular matter it was important that they should be in accord with each other. Employers were federated with each other and ship owners associated together and agreed with each other. In New South Wales they regarded the establishment of a customs union more favrably than this colony. That was due, as he believed, to this colony supporting protection too selfishly. He had always been a supporter of protection, but there was a limit beyond which he did not think it was judicious to go. If they could only get from an interchange of duties between the colonies it would be an incalculable benefit to the colony.  There were many articles that could be manufactured in this colony instead of importing them from other countries. The encouragement that would be given to local industrial enterprise if a customs union were arranged between the colonies would be almost incalculable.
Mr. B. Cowderoy, president of the Chamber of Commerce, said the bringing up of the question of establishing a customs union between the colonies was due to the Chamber of Commerce. The matter had gone on somewhat like a snowball, gathering as it rolled. The Government of this colony had communicated with the Governments of other colonies, and the Chamber of Commerce with other kindred bodies on the subject. A conference of representative bodies should be brought together to try and work the question out in a practical manner. If the principle were adopted, each colony, instead of having its markets confined within its own limited area, would have a market as large as the whole of Australia. The advantage of this must be obvious. He was astonished at the ignorance displayed by some of their leading statesmen when the question was being considered in Sydney some time back. The point raised by some of them was - how were they going to stand the loss of revenue estimated at £2,000,000 in the event of a customs union being established.  Evidently they had given very little study to the matter for otherwise it would be seen that the difficulty they raised was only a "bugbear", and had no existence in reality. If intercolonial free-trade were adopted the loss to this colony based upon the revenue two years ago would be less than £400,000, and if based upon the present revenue would be considerably less than this sums And although there would be an apparent loss, it was not a loss, because if they looked at the losses of the colonies in the aggregate if would only be the loss of duty between one colony and another and upon colonial products only. (Hear, hear.) The same revenue would be received by each colony from duties upon imported goods in the same proportion to each other as under the present systems. Each colony would continue to import the same goods as they imported now. The loss of revenue, therefore, would only be upon goods passing from one colony to another that did not come from a foreign market. What they should propose to do would be to exchange freely among themselves. A central authority could be appointed to distribute the duties on foreign imports in proportion to the population in respect to each colony. A customs union was considered the readiest mode of bringing about federation of our colonies. (Hear, hear.)
Mr. N. Levi, M.L.C., as president of the Chamber of Manufactures, desired to say that it was the unanimous wish of the chamber to see a customs union established between the colonies. He, in company with the late Mr. Steinfeld, when in Sydney, had thrashed out the question. He regretted to say the question was not so far advanced now apparently as it was some five years ago. He was quite sure that the arguments brought forth then would convince them that if they hoped for future prosperity they would establish a customs union. If they had a larger interchange between the colonies a much larger trade would be opened up. If they were to adopt a suggestion made some years ago to bring under the notice of the people of the mother country the resources of the colony they would do much to improve the position of the colony by attracting population to these shores. There were matters affecting the establishment of a customs union that required the best ideas of the best statesmen of this country.
