Lady Belmore and her sister have again been to see me and brought a number of nice interesting books for the patients. I am invited to dine at Government House on Tuesday next.
Thank you for all the trouble you have taken in this matter, indeed for the position I hold in this place altogether. I feel and always shall feel most grateful to you.  When I said goodbye to my friends at home I said goodbye also to my position in Society not expecting it to be recognized in a new country where the English idea of ladies undertaking this kind of work had not yet been tried. I cannot tell you what a relief I find in a little refined society.
 - . . I am in great distress and whenever I am I know how willing you always are to help me. This wretched Mr Roberts has been examined by the Commission and you would hear says he has Miss Nightingale's authority for abusing me. There must be some great mistake I am sure. He probably has given Miss Nightingale to understand I have behaved in an arbitary  manner and am very much disliked when no doubt she would say she was much disappointed to hear it and now I am afraid he will write to Miss N. this Mail and manage to get from her something confirmatory of what he has said which he could publish. Of course I would not hold my position for a day if the country was given to understand my work did not meet with Miss N's approval and therefore it is I want to know if you would be so very kind as to write a line this Mail to Miss N. telling her th:  the doctors and members of the Board are well satisfied and asking her if she thinks the work has been a failure in what respects she considers it to have failed. Such a sweeping charge I feel to be so cruel when I have fought so long against many difficulties.
 Thank you very much for all the trouble you have taken. You might well doubt your propriety in letting me see all the good things you have said, but instead of being conceited I will try and deserve them. I must say for N. S. Wales if there are loud talking blustering enemies there are also the truest and most constant of friends. In spite of the annoyance this quoting of Miss Nightingale's opinion has given me it is the greatest encouragement and comfort to me to find that those friends whose opinion I value have formed a different estimate of my work to that given by Mr Roberts.
