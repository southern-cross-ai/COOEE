2ndly. That Grants of Land to both married and single women as well as Children, have been and are by no means infrequent; that therefore Memorialist as precedent directs and analogies in her favour, and 
3rd. Waving  all consideration of the abstract principles on which was founded the stated objection of the late Governor to such Grants, that no such Grounds of objection could be discovered in Memorialist's particular case, Memoralist is willing to give every required Security for the due fulfillment of the Stipulations, that might be attached to any Land that might be granted to her.
Your Lordship's Memorialist here rests her case, and adverting to the difficulties and the exergencies  connected with those more particularly of providing for an increasing Herd of Horned Cattle, amounting to upwards of One Thousand and eighty Head, with no ground on which to depasture them with the exception of the small allotment, before mentioned, purchased by herself, and which now, from the common that was contiguous to it having been lately divided in Grants to various Individuals, is unequal to their support, trusts that she will not appear obtrusive in thus addressing Your Lordship, and, under the hope that the mere circumstance of Sex will not be allowed to operate to her prejudice, ventures to solicit that Your Lordship will be pleased to allow to her a Grant of Land of such extent, as to Your Lordship may see fit. And Your Lordship's Memorialist as in duty bound will ever pray.
