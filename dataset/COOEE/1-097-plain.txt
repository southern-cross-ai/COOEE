My dear Madam
It is so long since I have had the pleasure of hearing from you that at times I think you have forgotten us, which if the case would give me great uneasiness. The last letter I wrote you was by the Calcutta favored by Mr. who promised to call on you and deliver a letter and small box containing some native pears & for Miss Stokes made of the Beef Wood and a few other I things which I hoped would be acceptable as they were not common.
You no doubt wonder how we are going on Much in the old dull and uncomfortable way with respect to a religion Yet there is one thing which has a promising appearance. There is more attention payed to the Sabbath.  Mr. Marsden has both at Sydney and at Parramatta a very large congregation which is voluntary, so that by degrees they may be brought to fear his name and we do not know what the Lord may do for this Colony. He may yet raise up a faithful people to publish his name and though I may not live to see it yet it is a consoling hope that he will not entirely forsake this place, which at times I am almost tempted to think he will do for its great wickedness. You who live in the midst of Gospel blaze know not what it is to live among a people entirely ignorant of God and his ways. At times I feel so dead and lifeless that I think I have never been a child of God and doubt whether I shall even enjoy those seasons of grace which has afforded me such real comfort. Let me beg dear Madam an interest in your prayer's, that I may be enabled so to run that I may receive the prize of everlasting life.
Permit me to return you my sincere thanks for your kind attention to my dear Ann when she was in London. Mrs. Scott wrote me of your handsome present to her. I am anxiously looking for a ship from England as it is a twelvemonth since I have had letters from Yorkshire.
Poor Mrs. Johnson I feel much for her, it was a hard trial to part with so fine a girl as Milbah but the Lord knows what is best for his children.
My family is the same in number as when I wrote last - a girl & boy. Elizabeth grows a great girl and it is time she was in England, but I do not think I can muster courage to part with her. Charles is also an engaging little fellow and I trust he will be spared to us.
Mrs. Hughes begs her kind respects to you. When I see her she always enquires when I have heard from you. I believe I sent you word before that her husband is Master Blacksmith at Sydney, and what with their salary and other indulgences they are very comfortable. 
Mr. Marsden joins with me in kind remembrances to Mr. Stokes & family
and accept the same
From dear Madam
Your obliged friend
E. MARSDEN
