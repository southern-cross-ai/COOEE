During this past month since my arrival in Sydney in consequence of the absence of the Surveyor General, in the interior, I have been doing little more than getting myself settled &c and was engaged at the office for the first time Tracing a sketch of part of the line of Road to the Hunter's River. Purchased a horse for which I am to pay ยฃ27 - -
6th
Correcting the same sketch, and tracing one of the Roads to Bathurst.
7th
Finished and delivered to Major Mitchell the sketch of the Roads to Bathurst:-
8th
Continued sketch of the Hunter's River Roads.
9th
At the office untill 1/2 past One, continuing the above sketch:- afterwards engaged in making preparations for my journey - -
10th
Sunday
11th
Engaged all day in making preparations for my journey - received my written instructions &c.
12th
Engaged in the same way, to-day.
13th
Today drew 3 week's rations and slops for my men and in the evening pitched my tent
14th
Drew my arms and ammunition - engaged the whole day in preparing for my journey.
15th
Completed my preparations & sent my men & equipage forward to Long Bottom,
16th
At 1/4 past 6 P.M. left Sydney in company with Mr Macleod and got to Paramatta to Breakfast - after breakfast assisted him in measuring some allotments adjoining the New Catholic Chapel - Our men passed through & about one O' clock encamped at Broken Back Bridge, where I joined them in the afternoon - slept in my tent
Sunday 17th
Went to Paramatta church afterwards rode round the Government Domain -
Monday 18th Jany 1830
At 1/2 past 6 AM left our station at Broken Back Bridge, and about 2 PM encamped at the back of Best's 15 miles from Paramatta -
Tuesday 19th
Left Bests at 8 O'clock and at 1 PM encamped at the "finger Post" distant 15 miles, and 9 from Wisemans. The Road from Bests hitherto is in many places rough & bad, and, unlike that we travelled yesterday there are no signs of cultivation .. no small farms nor indeed a single habitation of any description nothing but interminable Forest - tho' here and there at the rise of a Hill, the country opens before you and presents a magnificent prospect -
Wednesday 20th
Left the "Finger post" and arrived at Wiseman's on the Hawkesbury. The leading features of the country are the same as in yesterday's march - ranges upon ranges of barren & unprofitable rock without an acre of land available for agricultural purposes. Approaching "Wiseman's" there are some pretty & romantic peeps of the Hawkesbury, winding through the valley; and there is the first good land I have seen in the Colony. It consists of prime but not extensive tracts of alluvial land; but it bears a miserably small proportion to the ranges of useless rock, which here rise perpendicularly to an immense height, clothed with timber & brush from base to summit & giving an irregularly wild & romantic affect to the Scenery. The pencil of Gaspard Poussin alone, could do justice to some of the scenes I have beheld today, with delight & admiration.
Thursday 21st
Measuring Dogherty's Farm, in company of Mr Macleod. Wrote to Major Mitchell (by dray) returning to Sydney, informing him of our arrival here.
Friday 22nd
Measuring Rose's farm - weather for several days has been dull & heavy, and tonight the rain is falling plentifully.
Saturday 23
Heavy rain at intervals throughout the day which has prevented our working in the field. Accompanied by McLeod & Larmer, crossed the River to Wiseman's to procure some corn &c - - Shot (at one shot) two birds of the Cockatoo Species - one of them ash-colour tinged with yellow about the head - throat canary colour - breast a dusky brown back & wings raven - tail consisting of twelve feathers two upper ones raven - 10 others the same colour, banded about the middle with broad bands of bright crimson-edged yellow The other of the same description excepting that it had no yellow about the throat, and had only one broad band of crimson on the 10 tail feathers. The heads irregularly formed with immensely powerful ...............  as jaws the under part of the beak quite square - & the upper part curved like all birds of the parrot kind - They were both of the same size & measured from tip to tip of the wings 3 feet 3 ins. and from beak to tail 19 ins -
Sunday 24th Jany
Took a ride round the different little vallies to the Eastward of our camp: the scenery is everywhere of the same magnificent description range upon range of rocky hills 4 or 500 feet in height, rising high over vallies, partly swamp, but still of the richest and most luxuriant alluvial soil - and wanting only English Capital and English industry to render them productive in the highest degree. The slopes of the hills too at the lower part where they are free from rock are well covered with very good herbage. Indeed land in the neighbourhood of Bath and of other places I know, of a description inferior to this, lets as high as 40/ to 50s/ an acre. - Two of our men this morning killed a black snake measuring about four feet six inches. It had just cast its skin when taken. On being opened, it was found to contain as many as eighteen (18) small ones ............  10 ins. long each enclosed in a separate wrap or bag sufficient proof that the black snake at least, is not oviparous, as some have maintained to be the case with all snakes.
Monday 25th
Went up Webb's Creek for the purpose of measuring Smith's - Rose's & Grono's Farms but being misinformed as to the distance, was obliged to return at night for the purpose of procuring provisions &c. These Farms are situated about 15 miles from the mouth of the Creek which is passable in a boat only about 10 miles. About a mile beyond the Creek ...............  altogether & becomes only a succession of fresh water Lagoons..
Tuesday 26th Jany 1830
Tuesday 26th Jany 1830
Started in a boat with five men & provisions for 3 days began measuring Smith's (or Hearn's) Farm: the land is very difficult of access, from the quantity of water which covers it in many places - & from the swampy nature of a great part of it.
Jany 27th-28th
27th-28th
Finished Smith's and began measuring Rose's Farm Finished Rose's Farm - and returned to the Camp - from the difficulties I met with in measuring these two Farms, I was deterred from commencing Grono's which is of the same description and much more extensive:- fearing that if I remained to finish it, I should not reach the camp by the time the bullocks returned from Sydney, and should thereby occasion a delay which is contrary to the spirit of my instructions. Such would certainly have been the case - for the bullocks returned this night to our camp 
Friday 29
Drawing sketches and preparing Reports of the Farms measured by me in this neighbourhood. The weather has been oppressively hot, and since dark there have been heavy storms of thunder, lightning & rain - wrote to major Mitchell a letter to accompany my reports
Saturday 30th
Wrote fair Copies of my letter & reports to send by Wiseman's man to Paramatta tomorrow morng Drew 14 days' rations from Wiseman's and sent the men forward to 12 mile hollow Twelve (now Ten) Mile Hollow - The Great North Road continues northward to the left, Simpson's Track (after Percy Simpson, engineer for the road's construction) branches off eastwards to the right. Stone footings of a building are amongst the trees in the centre.
Sunday 31st
Dined at Mr Simpson's
Monday 1st February
Thick & heavy rain during the day. In the afternoon left Wiseman's accompanied by Mr Larmer, & two guides for the Iron Gang Party No 9 distant 12 miles, where we arrived about 10 O' clock. I have suffered during the whole of this afternoon from a severe attack of Cholera Morbus which rendered me almost incapable of walking
Tuesday 2nd
Detained at the huts all day by illness & by heavy & incessant rain
Wednesday 3rd
Left the huts and reached the camp at Hungry Flat. Rain all day.
Thursday 4th
Heavy rain the greater part of the day but being very anxious to push on we travelled as far as Dennis's Dog Kennel.
Friday 5th
Weather fine, proceeded as far as Finch's
Saturday 6th Feby
In consequence of Mr Macleod not having joined us, I determined to await him here:- in the event he returned - & brought me a fresh man in lieu of O'Regan, who, for drunkenness & insolence was sent to an iron gang.
Sunday 7th
Walked to the summit of one of the loftiest ranges - the view was extensive - but both the mind & the eye become wearied of gazing on such interminable tracts of forest: I want the fine, open varied & expansive prospects which is presented from the hills in dear England. -
Monday 8th
Early in the morng moved from Finch's and proceeded to Blaxland's stock station on the Wollombi.- The country through which we have travelled today is different from any I have before seen - the ranges are less lofty, there rises more thickly clothed with herbage, & the vallies are rich & varied, affording excellent pasture. indeed the kind of scenery reminded me much of walking through rock and land in Somersetshire excepting that the trees are not apple. -
Tuesday 9th
Left the Station and arrived at the Reserve of Broke on the Wollombi - country similar to that we passed through yesterday.- Shot a large brown eagle measuring upwards of seven feet across the wings.
Wednesday 10th
Assisted Mr Macleod in measuring the government Reserve of Broke, on the Wollombi.. country picturesque, but great part of the land very poor & (though flat) abounding in Iron Bark - & in some parts with Apple and Gum -
Thursday 11th
Measuring a line of Road from the Reserve of Broke N32ยบ30'W towards the Reserve of Hay on the River Hunter - measured 6 miles & encamped. Visited the first camp of the natives, I have seen. There were about 60 men, women & children. I remained with them about an hour & saw them return for the night, each party or family kindling its own separate fire apart from the others. The place they were encamped in was a romantic spot on the bank of the Wollombi, and the scene altogether was to me one of peculiar interest. They were very curious  in observing every article of my dress & everything about me and were particularly amused with my watch & a pocket compass, especially the latter the use of which they appeared in some measure to comprehend. A whistle too which I wore suspended from my neck they were much pleased with & were very anxious to make it sound as I did -
I prevailed on some of them to "give me a specimen of their skill in throwing the "Boomerang" a weapon which is composed of hard wood nearly in the shape of a crescent, which they throw from them to a great distance, causing it to describe a circle and fall again at their feet. They asked us to see their "gins" or wives & very obligingly invited us to select a good one each & invitation, which I did not feel at all disposed to avail myself of. They are amazingly quick of comprehension & caught my name in a moment pronouncing it well & distinctly - they were much amused at our awkward attempts at pronouncing some of the native names - They are certainly a less disgusting set than those in the neighbourhood of Sydney indeed one of them named "Wednesday" was really a very fine man - but many of them are ugly & loathsome from dirt & starvation & I observed several who appeared to have defective eyes.
Friday 12th
This morning our black acquaintances surrounded our tents & two of the women & several children were delighted with some bread & tea which I gave them - Measuring the line on to the Reserve of Haye - nine miles & then walked to the Camp which was pitched on Howes Farm adjoining the Reserve & on the West bank of the Hunter. This is one of the great Rivers of Australia, & to my astonishment I found it now nothing but a wide bed of sand & gravel - with here & there a dirty pool of stagnant water. The heat for several days has been excessive & I have suffered much measuring over burning sand from thirst & fatigue

Thursday 18th
Finished measuring the reserve of Haye - The extreme difficulty we had in finding the boundaries from having no person to point them out and from the incorrectness in many places, of the section line, has caused to be longer in making this survey than we otherwise should have been - In the afternoon left the camp with Mr Macleod and encamped at night on the village Reserve, on the banks of the Wollombi -
Friday 19th
Measuring the village reserve - proceeded & reached Mr Mudie's on Patrick's plains - this is a fine open tract of land of about 5000 acres, commanding a fine view; & afforded great relief to the mind & the eye after travelling so long through pathless forest.
Saturday 20th
Left Mudie's and arrived at Dalwood's Mr Geo Wyndham's - here Mr Macleod left me in order to proceed to Newcastle.
Sunday 21
