('That in the opinion of this meeting it is the duty, and ought to be the object of the Land League to do all that lies in its power to return to Parliament, members favourable to the fundamental principles of the League, and this meeting pledges itself to support the League in carrying out the intention of this resolution.') He stated that the object of the meeting was to invite the people to join the Land League, so that by the force of numbers, by a powerful moral force, they would be able to assert their own rights, to obtain those rights, and to secure them for themselves and children for ever. He invited the people to come round to the other side of the 'waggon,' and enrol their names as members of the League. The Land Bill lately submitted to the Government by the Cowper Ministry was bad enough, but the principles since enunciated by Mr. Cowper were even more condemnatory. He blamed the meeting last night, because that it did not give a more patient and impartial hearing to the late members for the city, but he trusted that they had derived a lesson from the exhibition.  The Land League was charged with dividing the liberal interest, and thereby weakening the liberal cause. He denied that such was the effect of their present movement. They would strengthen the liberal interest and unite the truly liberal men, but they did not want a liberal cause In name only they wanted a liberal cause in fact. They wanted Electoral Reform and nothing else (Cheers). What they wanted, and what they must have was a wise and liberal land policy, with an extension of their rights and privileges. They would not stop merely because they gained a victory over the squatocracy of the country - no, they would go on and persevere in the good work till they had gained Electoral Reform on a broad and liberal basis. They would insist on laying down the fundamental principle of reform and then to carry it out. (Cheers). Unless they could procure men who would go into the House pledged to support those principles, they would not vote for any. Mr. Cowper's principles were in direct opposition to the principles of the land league. (Cries of No, no, and Yes, yes). It was those men who would support the re-election of Mr. Cowper that would be really chargeable with dividing the liberal interest. (Uproar). 
They had been told by Dr. Lang that until they succeeded in wresting a wise and liberal land bill from those whose interests on that measure were opposed to theirs, the city would continue to be overcrowded with an idle and an impoverished population, overcrowded in a manner which had been not inaptly compared to a collection of damaged merchandise. They wanted a wise and liberal land measure, one that would induce and hold out attractions to the people in the over populous cities and towns to disperse themselves over the country, and to settle down on comfortable farms and homesteads. Mr. Cowper had proved himself opposed to the introduction of a measure of that kind. (Cries of 'No, no', and 'Aye, aye.') Mr. Cowper had told them that he was utterly opposed to free selection - that he was in favour of the auction system, and he was followed in the same spirit by Mr. Dalley, who also had announced himself opposed to the principle of free selection, and was a supporter Of the auction system. Mr. R. Campbell, too, had enunciated similar principles, and all three of them were in all other respects opposed to every measure of a liberal tendency.  (Uproar and cries of 'No, no.') Upon the land question, Mr. Cowper was diametrically opposed to Dr. Lang. (No, no, and Aye, aye.) Dr. Lang had made his opinions upon this great question publicly known, and he had stated that it was injudicious and highly inexpedient, and a suicidal policy to reduce the land to five shillings an acre, while this very reduction was the leading and principal feature in Mr. Cowper's Land Bill. The League called upon the people to unite together, and to fight the battles of the country with the squatters who were arrayed against them, and to contest every inch of the ground with them until they carried out a measure that would secure for themselves and their children the blessings of independence. It had been truly said that the land question was the great question at issue between them, and if they did not now fight their own fight, and assert their claim to equal privileges, they would be trampled under foot for ever - (cheers) - the country would be swamped, and its inhabitants would become the serfs of the squatters. He would not further refer to Mr. Cowper's policy, but he would say that as long as he (Mr. Cowper) was at the head of a ministry they might not expect to see any liberal measure introduced into the Assembly. (Cheers and groans.) That gentleman had already betrayed the interests of the country, and if they trusted, in him again they would again be betrayed by him. The speaker concluded by calling on the meeting to join the League, and to support it, as well pecuniarily as with their countenance. He had much, pleasure in supporting the resolution.
Mr. CRAMP advised the electors that they must take care whom they put into power. If they had not mustered there in thousands, Mr. Cowper and his gang would have given the land away to the squatters. The land was for the people, and the motto of the Land League expressed this. But it was the House of Representatives who had to do the work for them, and it depended on whom they elected whether or not the principles they advocated should be carried into effect. 
He had no faith in a Parliament constituted as at present, and they must go for equal electoral districts, manhood suffrage, and no property qualification. With these conditions they would be able to accomplish the objects they had in contemplation.
Mr. READ said he had supported Mr. Cowper, but he had deceived him. He believed he had proved himself utterly incompetent to take the helm of affairs. (Loud cries of 'No,' attended with three groans for Read, and cries of 'he's drunk,' and 'stop till you're sober,' during which Mr. Read was checked, and sat down.
