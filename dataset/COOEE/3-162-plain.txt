My dear Matilda, 
I was very glad to hear from you and that you and the children were well. Isabella showed me their letters which were very nice and well done. We also saw your likeness and I was surprised to see so much change in you, but it will soon be nine years since I saw you, yet the time appears short it passes so quickly and you have had much care and trouble. I hope your Mother may long be spared to you. 
You and your children might do very well here but I should not wish to induce anyone to come as many find fault with it at first as I did, but I trust with God's blessing we shall do well yet. Education costs much. Fanny, Henrietta, William and Alexander's amounts to nearly Â£50 a year, servants wages (one) 9 / - per week and 10 / - per week rent, but I expect the children will be fitted for respectable situations, and the money will not be thrown away. 
I am sorry to say your Uncle's health is very middling latterly. He has not been able to attend to business this week, he has a bad cough and looks very delicate, that I am very uneasy about him but I hope it may not signify - he is very low spirited and you never saw anyone more altered in every way. 
We were glad to hear poor Lucy had got a comfortable situation. I suppose you go to see her when you go to Dublin. I intend writing to her soon. Isabella I expect will be married shortly, the latter end of January or beginning of February, to one of her employers Mr. Scott. He is from the County Tyrone, a respectable steady, sober young man. I don't know that he has got any money to boast of but he has a good business and there is every prospect of happiness. They have been long attached - she has refused 3 others within the last 3 weeks. 
Ruth and hers are very well - her husband is a sadler and has property in houses and land, and I believe are very comfortable but have it all to themselves - am never asked to spend a day. She did ask me once or twice but she had no dinner, keeps everything for themselves - he does not go home till night from the shop. She charges her brother Aleck 2/ - for his dinner of a Sunday yet he often spends it with us. 
Isabella has no idea of inducing Mary or Bessie to come out here, they would only be a burden to her or us if out of situations. I know two young girls looking for places these months back and can't procure them. Business is so dull, particularly at this season of the year just before the harvest. It will soon be in now and I trust a plentiful one. We have had a very favorable season. Till latterly it has been rather dry, but I trust there has not been much injury done to the crop. 
I don't make my own bread now it was so troublesome sending it out to be baked. We send our meat to the bakehouse, no one here roasts it at the fire its too expensive, and makes the house too warm. You think you could not bear the heat, but it does not last long without intervals of cold - we have heavenly weather at times. This is the most disagreeable month, many days so dusty that you should be quite astonished where it comes from, but on the whole I don't find fault with the climate and believe it healthier than home. 
Should you ever come you might get the situation of Matron to an emigrant vessel and you could have your children with you for a trifle, but I should never advise you to come while you can live at home. 
Dublin must appear altered to you. I suppose there is not a Wyly in it now. Was there anything heard of Charles? I regret dear Nancy and Fanny very much, and when I heard poor Fanny was in Melbourne I thought I had her in my grasp yet she never was able to write to me and a few weeks after was in her grave. 5 of the family buried in Melbourne. 
I am very glad Isabella will soon have a home of her own and not be serving for others. She has got very thin latterly but I expect she will get plump again shortly. You are too far off to send you any of the cake. She has got a fine stock of clothing, a chest of drawers etc. etc. and a share in a Building Society, and I am sure she will make a good wife. 
I had to leave this letter so often it is quite disjointed but I shall take more time for the next.  Your Uncle and the children unite in dear love to you and yours, and ever believe me your 
Very affectionate Aunt
