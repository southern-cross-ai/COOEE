CAPTAIN FLINDERS, late Commander of His Majesty's Sloop INVESTIGATOR, and Mr. PARK, Commander of the Ship CATO, arrived at Government House at half past 3 in the afternoon of the 8th Instant, with the following disagreeable Intelligence, as communicated in the following LETTER to His EXCELLENCY.
"Sydney, New South Wales, Sept. 9, 1803.
"SIR,
"I have to inform you of my arrival here yesterday, in a Six-oar'd Cutter belonging to His Majesty's Armed Vessel PORPOISE, commanded by Lieut. FOWLER: which ship, I am sorry to state to Your EXCELLENCY, I left on shore upon Coral Rock without any prospect of her being saved, in Latitude 22° 11' South, and Longitude 155° 13' East, being 196 miles to the N 38° E. from Sandy Cape, and 729 miles from this Port! The Ship CATO, which was in Company, is entirely lost upon the same Reef and broken to pieces without any thing having been saved from her: but the crew, with the exception of Three, are with the Whole of the Officers, Crew and Passengers of the PORPOISE, upon a small Sand-bank near the Wrecks, with sufficient Provisions and Water saved from the PORPOISE to subsist the whole, amounting to 80 Men, for Three Months.
"Accompanied by the Commander of the CATO, Mr. JOHN PARK, and Twelve Men, I left Wreck Reef in the Cutter with Three Weeks' Provisions, on Friday, August 26th, in the morning, and on the 28th in the evening made the Land near Indian Head; from whence I kept the coast on board to this place.
"I cannot state the Extent of Wreck Reef to the Eastward, but a Bank is visible in that direction six or seven miles from the Wrecks. In a West direction we rowed along the Reef twelve miles, but saw no other dangers in the Passage towards Sandy Cape. - There are several Passages through the Reef and Anchorage in from 15 to 22 fathom; upon a sandy bottom, the Flag-staff upon Wreck-reef Bank bearing South-East to South - South - West, distant from three - quarters to one - and - quarter mile.
"After the above Statement it is unnecessary for me to make Application to Your EXCELLENCY to furnish me with the means of Relieving the Crews of the two Ships from the precarious situation in which they are placed, since your Humanity and former unremitting Attention to the INVESTIGATOR and PORPOISE are Sureties that the earliest and most effectual means will be taken, either to bring them back to the Port, or to send them and myself onward towards' England.
"I enclose to Your EXCELLENCY a Letter from Lieut. FOWLER upon the occasion; and as he refers to me for the Particulars of the Wreck, an Account thereof is also inclosed.
"I think it proper to notice to Your EXCELLENCY, that the great exertions of Lieut. FOWLER and his Officers and Company, as well as the Passengers belonging to the INVESTIGATOR in saving His Majesty's Stores, have been very praiseworthy; and I judge that the precautions that were taken will exonerate the Commander of the PORPOISE from the blame that might otherwise be attached to the Loss of His Majesty's Armed Vessel.
"I have the honour to be
"Your EXCELLENCY'S
"Obedient humble Servant
"MATTHEW FLINDERS."
