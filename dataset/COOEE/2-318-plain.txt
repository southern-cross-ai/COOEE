My dear Papa
I did not have the pleasure of a letter from you this time nor do I expect to find one in the Bale but of course I perused that with which you favored my good man and it afforded me very good satisfaction though I rather missed the appendage of a page or two to my own cheek.  He requests that I will write instead of himself as he is so dreadfully busy, this being seed time and ploughing season for the garden and vineyard. Though he has put it into rather bad hands, I fear, he expresses his acknowledgement of your goodness in attending to so many troublesome matters at home and supporting us as you have done abroad by encouraging and affectionate attentions.
We have been very fortunate in receiving letters and parcels so punctually. I hope ours have reached you relative to the previous package per Unicorn.
I am very much cheered by hearing of Matilda's better health, how earnestly I hope it will continue to improve. I do not wonder at your finding the house at Dorchester too small, I never considered it by any means a pretty place. We had many comforts there, indeed I think I may go so far as to say many little elegancies but I rather considered them thrown away upon so contracted a residence, in my opinion not very nicely situated. The attraction to you in going thither was doubtless to be near dear Matilda and its having been our residence of old, but I do not wonder at your preferring Cuddesdon after making trial of it.
My letter I fear will not contain much matter of interest, there is nothing new to relate, 'tis the same round of duties as formerly. We made fifty gallons of wine from the vintage of February last which is highly praised by all tastes and I assure you we enjoy it much ourselves at dinner occasionally. We expect it will last the year out if we do not draw it over freely for family consumption but reserve it to enjoy with our friends.
Mr. Brown went down to Leschenault, a settlement formed by a company in London about the time that we came out, of which Mr. Clifton is Chief Commissioner. It is about one hundred and seventy miles from this, I accompanied him as far as Perth where he left me to visit our friends there. I staid only ten days, a long time for me and a sufficient one to be called upon by the inhabitants whose acquaintance I had not previously made. The new Governor and his Lady had arrived not many weeks previously so we paid our respects to them.
Mr. Brown was exceedingly pleased with the great man Wailer Clifton Esqur. who accompanied him two days on horseback to call upon the surrounding gentry and view the splendid country which has great charms to the partial and enthusiastic W.C. but did not equal the York District in the unpenetrating eyes of T.B. The object of the journey to Leschenault was to procure a fine Arabian Horse from a gentleman in the neighbourhood with a view of improving the breed of horses in this part of the country.  Mr. Brown succeeded in his mission and Yussuf is now here not purchased but on hire for a season and a noble animal he is, delighting the eyes not only of good judges but of all the Ladies who have seen him.
The Bale is not yet come up and I think it will be a week or two before Mr. Brown will be able to fetch it from Mr. Moore's at Guildford. I assure you it is most acceptable and makes a little money go a great way in the payment of work people. It seems grasping to speak of another but necessity obliges me to speak up for some boots and shoes which are so very difficult to get here and when procured intolerably dear and inferior. Matilda once enclosed some in one of the cases, some black Prunella boots at 3/6 per pair, they were quite right in length but too narrow as were all the last lot both for Mrs. Viveash and myself. Nevertheless we wore them and I have now come to the last pair. Could more of the black prunella be procured at 3/6 the same length but a little wider, they would be just the thing, I suppose fawn colour would not be any dearer. They would make a variety and are great favorites with me. Also a prunella cloth dress same material that children's cloaks are made of would be a very useful and suitable garment, not over dear and it would provide me a pattern for the fashion. You see it is hard to root the seeds of vanity from my ways and nature.
I was much gratified with dear Matilda's letter that you prevailed upon her to write. I was apprehensive that it would have been my lot never to hear from her again, but now I have great hope that she will recover.
Our boys are much the same as usual except the Baby who is very delicate though so forward in many things. He is very subject to dysentery and is now suffering from it though rather better than he has been. The present attack has lasted more than three months. Viveash has been prescribing for him and has lately seen him. He does not like some of the symptoms but has hope of the child's recovery. I think the complaint will be better when teething is a little over. You do not say any thing of little Eliza this time. I think you had better send her to me as I have no girl unless you are afraid of all the boys falling in love with her and so causing strife in a peaceable household. And now I must say good bye and not tire you with nonsense
My dear Papa
Yours Affectionately
Eliza Brown
