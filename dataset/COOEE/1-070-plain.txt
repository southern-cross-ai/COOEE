SIR,
By an attentive perusal of a Moral Contemplation contained in your Publication of last Week, I feel it my duty to assist the exertions of AMICUS, however feeble my capacity.
A consciousness of the blessings we enjoy may truly be considered as indispensible to human happiness; though we oftentimes regard with thankless indifference those comforts, to have hoped for which might in all probability at a former period have been considered a presumption; whence it may be generally inferred that ambition is subservient more to our immediate circumstance than to the dominion of reason, and that we sometimes sacrifice the blessings of composure and tranquillity to indulging in the anticipations of unbridled fancy.  
From the word ambition may be understood a desire to be, or perhaps only to be considered as moving in a sphere, or being possessed of qualities to which we may not reasonably pretend. These qualities may be briefly distinguished into natural and accidental; the first existing in the mind, the latter derived from the possession of riches, both of which are capable of improvement, and of being applied to the general advantage of society, few are stimulated to obtain a rank with the former; but many supposing the latter within their reach perpetually devote themselves to hope, doubt, and fear alternately, and in pursuit of a shadow, lose the substance altogether. ...
Society may be compared with a magnificent structure, which step by step ascends to its most elevated and exalted pinnacle, the symmetry of which is equally dependent upon all its parts; in either of these if an imperfection be discovered, it must, for the benefit of the whole, be rooted out. To the human mind the allusion may also be applied, as a single blemish must disfigure, and if not eradicated in time, destroy the fabric. Most of our evils originate in discontent of our circumstances and situations, to alter or AMEND which, recourse is too frequently had to a precipitancy by which we are enveloped in surrounding storms.
It may fastidiously be argued that contentment is not indiscriminately attainable to every rank in life; but to so shallow a presumption it may be answered, that the blessing exists only in the mind, in which it assumes an angel shape, that can minister consolation in the most humble retreat.
The labouring orders in this Colony are amply furnished with the materials requisite to contentment in the exercise of industry, and the consequent reward to all that are deserving. The fields and forests alike present resources, and their comforts are lessened or increased by their frugality, oeconomy, and perseverance. These are essential qualities, easy of attainment, and principally constitute the duties of the poor.
