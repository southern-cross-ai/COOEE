It is the duty of the State to see that the men who go to the ballot-box understand the questions which are submitted to their decision, - and that they bring an intelligent mind to bear upon the exercise of the franchise.  If they do not use their political privileges intelligently, what will be the effect on this House? It is a truism that the whole is equal to the parts composing it; and if the parts composing this House are not men of intelligence, the House itself is bound to reflect their want of intelligence. Therefore, for the welfare and good government of the country, it is essential that those to whom political power is given should be educated, and be able to exercise that power intelligently. That can only be done by establishing a system of free education throughout the length and breadth of the country. It must be free, because it is to be compulsory; and, being compulsory, it can only lead to one result - that the next generation will be able to boast that there is no Victorian uneducated. With its people educated, I believe that this country, whether in commerce, in political power, or in anything else, will not be behind other nations in the race of life.
