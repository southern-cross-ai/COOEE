The public are now enabled to have better, cheaper, and more cleanly light than has been possible heretofore. The dim days of oil and tallow are gone by, as far as the lighting of shops and warehouses are concerned. These materials must needs give place to gas lamps, which are, in every respect, superior to any other mode of lighting that exists. The Company generally, its Directors, Secretary, and Engineer, deserve the sincerest thanks of the community, for their perseverance under many obstacles; and we trust that they will reap a reward where they most require it, namely, in the abundant, and indeed universal patronage of the public. It is however not probable, we are afraid, that the streets will be regularly lit up with gas until a Municipal Corporation is in existence. When, however, the law creating this institution is passed, it will, we trust, next after taking care of the sufficient draining and paving of the town, be the early object of the corporation to light up our streets with gas.
There is, nevertheless, at present one class of persons whom we would recommend to patronize the Company forthwith. We allude to the publicans. The law compels each of them to have a lamp burning over their doors throughout the night.  Now what an advantage does the adoption of gas for these lamps afford them. Not alone is gas light cheaper and more brilliant, but the lamps, if securely fitted with glass, never go out. Whereas oil lamps are constantly expiring, and the publican is every now and then fined for not having his lamp burning. We know one case of a publican, in which he paid in a single twelve-month, not less than Â£14 for such fines. Upon a principle of self-interest then every innkeeper should have a gas lamp fitted up. The banks, moreover, might well follow the example of the Union Bank, which by the adoption of gas lighting is really an ornament to the town. An additional appearance of respectability would be given to their buildings, and the course taken by the Union Bank would be in every way creditable to all. On the whole we would strongly appeal to the public in behalf of the Gas Company. They have expended much time, money, and labour, in an enterprize which is peculiarly calculated to benefit the town of Sydney, and it is but just, fitting, and proper that they should reap a proportionate reward.
