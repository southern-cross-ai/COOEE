The nature of the dispute was abstract and technical. Who outside the ranks of the Labour Party cared whether Trades-Unionism, merely as Trades-Unionism, was strengthened or weakened in the back-blocks? The machinery which the shearers had called into existence, had hitherto performed its work well. What if it was now threatened by a hostile power greater than itself? The claims of the marine officers had been admitted by the shipowners. Then what farther use was the affiliation by which they had gained those concessions. It was not to be expected that the majority of people should see that both cases involved another step towards the perfecting of organisations whose perfection is absolutely necessary if labour is to have as much as a voice in the terms upon which it will engage to serve in the station shed or on the steamboat bridge. But the general public knew nothing about that. All they did know was that the Unions were fighting a question of organisation, about which they understood little and cared less. It was not enough that the cause of humanity was the very marrow in the bone of contention. Nobody was being beaten to death, or even expected to work for five-pence an hour like a London Docker. Our drama was a domestic tragedy, and when we appealed to the bar of "public opinion" we were told to go home and shake hands.
Not only had "public opinion" no particular reason for wanting what we wanted, but it had the strongest reason for not wanting what we were misrepresented to want. Our opponents ingeniously pretended that the presence of two or three ship's officers on the Maritime Council would be subversive to discipline at sea. Nobody desired that; and without considering whether anything so absurd could possibly be the result, the "classes" took alarm, and said "At all hazards we will maintain discipline on board ship by keeping the officers away from the Maritime Council." Then with regard to the boycott of non-Union shorn wool, most people apparently failed to realize the end to which it was a means. The means itself was but another instance of the "tyranny of Labour". What else could it be? Ignoring the terrible handicap with which the masses began their struggle some half century ago, and forgetting to take into account the distance that still exists between them and their "betters" - the good things of life to which they are justly entitled, but do not possess - people had been thinking of nothing but the steady progress of the working-class during recent years. The only question, asked with fretful repetition, was, "Will they never be satisfied?" Thus Ignorance mated with Indifference begat the Spirit of Profound Contempt for the Working Man, and they all three went to war in Support of the House of Have.
These were the elements against which we had to count. A strong and friendly press might have subdued, if not overcome, them entirely. But if strong, so much the worse, for the daily press, so far from being friendly, was not even impartial. Only a few months previously the question as to who should control its policy - the editor or the capitalists behind it - had been fought out in the office of perhaps the most "democratic" newspaper in Sydney; and, as everybody knows, the capitalists, walking rough-shod over the dead bodies of two editors, sustained their point.  Henceforward the voice of that most "democratic" of papers was admittedly the voice of an Esau. Its opinions were the opinions of the land shark and the tramway grabber, of men responsible for the management of companies working their employees almost double the number of hours prescribed by the rules of Trades Unionism, nay, of men largely interested in the very steamship companies whom the Unions were fighting. Surely it was not within the region of possibility that we should get impartial treatment at such hands. The proprietors of that particular journal did their worst, and the rest of the metropolitan press being similarly under the control of embittered and powerful capitalists was equally determined, if less hysterical, in its antagonism to the Unions.
The whole artillery of daily journalism opened fire upon us. The few breaches of the peace that occurred, so much to the disgust of the Defence Committee, were magnified into riots, for which the very principles of Trades Unionism were held responsible. The most trivial circumstances, perverted into acts of intimidation, were gathered like so many rusty nails from the journalistic gutter for explosion in the shape of paragraphic bombs on the following morning. On the other hand, when clerks were dismissed from their employment for refusing to parade as special constables, when sermons and addresses favourable to the cause of labour were delivered by men in responsible public positions, the leader writers maintained an ominous silence. Perhaps the best example of the treatment about which we complain lies in a fact to which we have already alluded. No doubt, sincerely desirous of the honour of bringing the strike to an end by mediation, the Mayor of Sydney (Mr. Sydney Burdekin) ventured upon the publication of a judicial summary of the case. Even as printed in the two morning papers, anybody reading between the lines could form a pretty accurate guess upon which side the author's sympathies lay. That was all right. Mr. Burdekin, or any other gentleman had a perfect right to offer his services as mediator whatever his views might be, provided of course that he either kept them to himself or explained them faithfully beforehand. But what can be thought of the impartiality of a newspaper editor who, upon receiving a statement of the views of a probable mediator, and finding them fatally partial, takes good care that they are judiciously tempered before publication?  The attitude of one journal, and one journal alone - the Sydney Bulletin - commends itself to the Committee, consistently extreme and extremely consistent, its clear cut and thoughtful articles, not always commendatory, often cold and cynical, but uniformly worthy of respectful study, have at all times abounded in sound advice for the Labour Party.
If the press fought well for its Master no one can say the same of the church. The newspaper editors did lead "public opinion". The clergy left it to grope amidst the gloom of Sacerdotal clap-trap. Indeed, the clergy throughout the strike remind one of the priests who, accompanying the Utopians to war, withdrew to a respectable distance from the battlefield, and there prayed that victory might rest with their own side, but that there might not be much bloodshed on either side. The fact is - and it is a matter for deep regret - that the clergy were afraid to speak out. Their office bearers, the men upon whom they chiefly rely for pecuniary support, the men who, lending an air of worldly respectability to their churches, are thrust into positions of solemn dignity, were arrayed against us, often our bitterest opponents. To give Offence to them was to quarrel with the means of grace. So the clergy in their weakness took a middle course and failed to win from the working-classes even the respect accorded to honest opposition. We recognise the stamp of a man in the Queensland Bishop, who worked on the wharves with the blacklegs, but it is to be feared that the clergy as a body,' through their want of straightforwardness during the strike, have done much to lose their opportunities of well-doing among the workers of Australia. Our respect is due, however, to that Queensland Bishop for his manly opposition, our sincerest gratitude to Cardinal Moran, the Rev. Dr. Roseby, the Rev. H. L. Jackson, the Rev. George Walters and a few other clergymen for their Christ-like sympathy with the struggling masses.
And now a word about the politicians. It would be hard to say that there are no honest politicians. There must be. But this the Labour Defence Committee recognised from the first: that politics as generally understood when stripped of its drapery, is merely a game of self-advancement; and that in one sense or another Members of Parliament are almost to a man "on the make". At the present time both Houses are composed almost exclusively of men directly interested in the supremacy of Capital and, of course, opposed to any social changes tending to a more even distribution of wealth. Both parties are ready to use the working-classes for their own ends; neither is willing for the working-classes to use it. This was unmistakably exemplified during the strike. The Labour Party had one or two courageous friends on either side in the Legislative Assembly; but the temper of the House itself was antagonistic to the last degree.  That the Government selected its special constables almost exclusively from men imbued with class-hatred, that they permitted hostile displays of force on the part of our opponents, and facilitated undermanned ships in putting to sea, is hardly worth comment in the face of the ready approval of the Opposition. True, when the fight was over and after he could have been of any possible assistance to the cause, Mr. Dibbs found his way to a platform in the Domain. But it all amounts to this: whilst we have no cause for gratitude to the Government for their attitude during the strike, we have no reason for believing that the Opposition, had it been in office, would have acted more fairly.
The last, and perhaps after all the most potent of the influences to which we must attribute the result of the strike, is the fact that whilst we were not prepared, the employers were. True, their Union had been in existence for less than two years, but with boundless Capital at its hack, with the services of capable agitators, with the experience of other organisations to guide them, and above all with an abundance of unemployed labour (itself an emphatic comment on the industrial condition of the Colony!) to help them in the pinch, it proved an unexpectedly well-furnished rival.
