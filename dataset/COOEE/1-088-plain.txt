Dr Madam
I received yours by the Calcutta and need not inform you we were exceeding glad to hear from you. The seeds you wrote for Mrs. Marsden has put up in a small box with some others, which I hope you will receive safe. I have sent them by one of the officers of the Calcutta, to whom I refer you for information of this Colony. This gentleman can give Mr. Stokes a particular account of the wild cattle, he having paid two visits to the Cow pastures . Mrs. Marsden has visited them once about a month ago. Where the wild cattle feed, it is the finest country my imagination can conceive, the hills and vales are so beautiful. It was my intention to have sent you a good collection of seeds by the Calcutta, but have been prevented from collecting them by the Irish rebels, they have given us some trouble lately and put the Colony in much danger.  
I hope they are subdued for the present - they had laid a plan for a general insurrection, fortunately for us it did not succeed. I am truly sorry to hear of the death of Mrs. Goff & also of poor Milbah Johnson - both Mr. and Mrs. Johnson would be greatly afflicted. I can feel for them having lost two fine boys myself. They are not lost, in that glorious morning of the Resurrection of the just, we shall all meet again - Parents & Children shall see each other if numbered amongst the Saints they part no more for ever. If we are conducted to glory from this seive of iniquity it will an eternal wonder. I often think I must return to England and enjoy the society of God's people again before my soul can have any bright prospects of Glory. The thought may be vain, because God's power is infinite, and he is everywhere present. Everything here is so unlike religion, so unlike God & his glory. I often feel an anxious wish to see my native land, but when the time will come I know not. Government seems not to pay much attention to religion here, as they send me no assistance. My duty is very hard, the Colony is become very extensive now, and a great number of people in it, with only myself as a Minister. Should any come, I hope he will be a pious man and hearty in the cause of God. I wish you would inform me particularly what you want, & if I can get it here, you shall have it - the great difficulty is to get an honest man to take what we wish to send without stealing it. My private letters are sometimes stolen, and if not stolen, opened by some person unknown. The greatest rogues in the world come and go from this Colony. If you ever get a letter it must be a chance business. I think you will get this safe, the young man has too much honour to neglect delivering it should he come himself. You will give my kindest respects to Mr. Hollis with Mrs. M's.
I have the honour to be Dear Madam Yours respectfully
SAMUEL MARSDEN.
P.S. - Mrs. Marsden begs Miss Stokes' acceptance of a little netting box made of the wood of this country which you will find in the box of seeds.
