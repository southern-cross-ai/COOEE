I was taken ill the night of the Ball given in honor of the Governor's visit to Bathurst and was so alarmingly ill that for some days I could not leave Mrs Whitton's, and then I was taken to Alloway Bank where I remained till the 2nd of May - . - however, through God's mercy alone I was restored to my family and am now feeling pretty well.
 - I have not been well, having had a feeling of faintness coming over me and constant headache - .
28th. I was very ill all day with fainting fits. Dr McHattie came and prescribed for me - it is from the effects of my recent illness.
