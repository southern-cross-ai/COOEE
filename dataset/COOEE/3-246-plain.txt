Busby has lately bought this place, (Edgecliff House) the late residence of the late Judge Wise. It is a large and handsome house conveniently situated about a mile and a half from the city in a beautiful garden with splendid views of the harbour all round. He intends to bring his family here every winter that they may enjoy society and be at Cassilis during the busy months when the sheep require attention: they are now preparing to return there and have already let the house for six months to a nice family for £200 which will save his keeping it. They have been living in great style warranted by his thriving establishments both at Cassilis and in Queensland: in fact there is no one I know that manages his affairs better. We are most especially fortunate in having such a worthy son-in-law who is all kindness to our daughter. I have not been one of the fortunate settlers although I have managed to go on with a fair share of comforts around me, perhaps quite enough, for great success does not improve the character and disposition of man. I made a mistake in the first instance in purchasing so much landed property instead of employing my capital in the cultivation of sheep and cattle on the wild wastes of the interior: this and a disinclination to speculate has keep  me just rubbing on with sufficient income to meet our reasonable wants but not enough to go visiting about in the old countries as most of my acquaintances do: however a change is gradually taking place and this landed property is assuming its proper value and will no doubt be the most desirable in the end. Pomeroy is a magnificent estate and will be a principality to the young ones. I have lately changed the character of its management by selling off all the livestock and giving up farming on my own account having leased the land to tenants keeping nothing in my own hands but the house garden and pleasure grounds. I do not get so large an income by these means but it is more certain and free from anxiety and will yearly increase as the district becomes populated: besides it leaves us at liberty to go and come when we like. It is a Derryman and woman that rents the home farm (William Gallagher) who was for seven years foreman in Mr. Watt's brewery. He came to this colony 25 years ago when I employed him and have since had opportunity of befriending them which has caused an unusual degree of attachment in him and his whole family (now consisting of four young women and two sons) to us. He and she have proved themselves to be guided by the strictest integrity and they possess a delicacy of feeling that any gentleman might be proud of. Consequently I have the highest respect for them and notwithstanding their class I estimate them more as friends than otherwise. They have left a valuable farm in Cumberland and came up to live with me, I believe from pure affection: he rents all the enclosures about the house and supplies us with wood, water, dairy produce, vegetables and poultry taking charge of the premises in my absence so that I have none but the indoor servants to look after and they are a family I have had on and off for 18 years so that although I am not so rich in money as my neighbours we are very comfortable and having got rid of farming work I can amuse myself by improving the place which I have done to considerable extent lately. I am voluntarily building a nice stone cottage of fine rooms with detached kitchen and offices as a residence for the Gallaghers as it is both my desire and interest to make them as comfortable as possible for we will probably end our days together: he and I have many talks of old Derry and would be glad to hear from you of anything that is going on. 
Within the last two years we have succeeded in establishing a bishopric in the South-Western part of New South Wales. The Bishop Goulburn (Mesac Thomas) who has for some years been the principal correspondent or secretary of the Society for the Diffusion of the Gospel, living in London, is a very superior man admirably calculated for organising the extensive diocese he has undertaken and not less so by his energetic and amiable wife. They are a strong healthy couple without family, active, devoted to the undertaking and so affable, with a proper proportion of dignity that they secure the goodwill of every person. Within twelve months of his arrival they travelled 2,000 in their own carriage round the distant parts of the diocese no small undertaking as they have lived nearly all their lives in London. We have managed to collect in money and landed property £20,000 as an endowment which now produces about £1,200 per annum yearly increasing and this entirely from private subscriptions. He is establishing clergymen and schools everywhere so that an immensity of good is being effected.
