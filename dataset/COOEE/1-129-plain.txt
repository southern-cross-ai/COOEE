Dear Madam,
I shall not have time to write to Mr. Thomas Stokes. I did not know but the acc had been settled between Mr. Hassall and him, till I received his letter. He will however receive the whole amount by this conveyance in a bill upon his Majesty's Treasury. The Revolution has very much injured the private affairs of some but will prove a great benefit to the Colony at large. It has been owing to the state of the Colony that the money was not paid long since. I was sorry in my own mind that I had recommended Mr. Hassall without first knowing what would be the pecuniary state of the Colony. I cannot but blame myself a little for not calling upon Mr. Hassall before and knowing positively that the money had been paid.
You will have heard of our affliction on account of Mrs. Marsden. This is a very heavy trial and loss to me. None knew the value of such a companion as she has been to me. I am thankful that she is spared and is something better. She is able to walk about a little, and can make herself understood, and manage the family to a certain extent.  One hand is in a great measure useless and she is very lame, complains frequently of pains in her head. It was a great blessing that I took out with me a female servant Mrs. Bishop. She proves a very valuable woman in my little family and is such a comfort to Mrs. Marsden as she is a sensible woman and a very faithful servant. Providence is particularly kind to us and always has been - the Lord will provide. I have no cause to complain of the Divine Goodness. He has blessed me in my going out and my coming in in my basket and in my store we have all good things now to enjoy. My return to England will I trust be the means of laying the foundation of Christs Church upon so firm a foundation that Satan shall never be able to overturn it in this part of the world. We have now cleared the Colony of all the catholic priests have schools established in almost every district so that the rising generation will be brought up in the principles of the Protestant religion. We have 5 pious schoolmasters and with my two colleagues I hope something will be done.
I shall always be happy to hear that you and your family are well and of Mr. and Mrs. Hughes. You have the prospect of leaving behind you a seed to serve the Lord. May the good Lord add to their number, till not a single slough is left behind in Egypt. The times with you appear to us from the public prints to be awful. God is punishing the Inhabitants of the World for their wickedness in a very distressing manner. What will be the end of these things. I think we are happy in being at such a distance from the seat of war and all its calamities. Our settlement abounds with plenty. I wish you could take some of our surplus grain. We had many thousands of bushels this year which we could not consume. Our harvest is just at hand and very heavy crops and our Stores in a great measure full. We have about 20,000 head of Cattle and about 50,000 Sheep. I think this will in time become one of the finest countries in the world. I wish many of my pious friends were as well provided for as we are. I hope Mr. Stokes is well. Give my kind respects to him and to all your family and to Mr. and Mrs. Hughes. I feel grateful to you all for your past attentions.  
Should the Revd. Mr. Foster he still alive give our most affectionate regards to him and Miss Searle. All my daughters unite with me in best wishes for you and yours. 
I am
Dear Madam
Yours respectfully
SAMUEL Marsden
