It has been suggested and certainly would prove (as I have an opportunity of judging from having, very soon after arrival, yielded to the wish of the Governor to preside at the weekly Bench of Magistrates here) of beneficial and wholesome provision, if the Justices of V.D. Land, and indeed even in this territory, were enabled legally to form and act as a sort of Sessions for the cognizance of petty offences; but it appears to me that all the criminal jurisdiction of and in the territory and its dependencies belongs only to and can be exercised only by the Court of Record erected by the Charter, except so far as given to magistrates summarily under particular Acts of Parliament.
