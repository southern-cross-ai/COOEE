 take a run in the bush the length of Echuca and see what it is like. I think he would do very well here and the dry climate might suit him better than home. I must say for myself that I like the country well although it is rough and wild looking in places. Indeed I would not like going to Belfast and taking a situation there at the wages I could get. I always hold up the name of Belfast here but still wages are small
