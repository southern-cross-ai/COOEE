I am paying 8% for £75 to fence it with and believe it will pay well, if I only have luck and no dingoes come around. It is, I can assure you, nothing to lose £30 or £40 in a single night by dingoes. The Government give 10s. 0d. reward for every dingo destroyed, the proof being the scalp and tail  
I have refused another (cash) offer of £500 for my place but will battle along now. The weather is glorious here now and the bush simply goregous with colour, blue, yellow and white flowers, creepers, etc mixed in one dense mass as far as one can see. If you ever pay me a visit come in September as from then till Christmas is the pick of all the year. 
Carrie sent me some woollen socks which were very acceptable I can assure you. I suffered with indigestion from the same cause as you and went under chloroform and had the lot (back teeth) yanked out and although I have had no others instead still I suffer no toothache and the other trouble a little Siegle's syrup always cures. A teaspoonful neat after meals and before going to bed will shift old Nick.
