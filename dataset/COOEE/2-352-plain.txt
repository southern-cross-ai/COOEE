(Held Monday, 11th June, 1849.)
It is well known that the Hashemy had been unexpectedly delayed in her voyage from Port Phillip, but during Saturday and Sunday, previous to her arrival, very considerable excitement prevailed throughout the city. The public demonstration against the arrival of this convict ship took place at 11 A.M. Monday at the Circular Wharf. The day was very wet, and the meeting was very orderly.
Mr. Robert Campbell was unanimously called upon to preside. He said no doubt there were those in the colony who hailed the advent of the convicts amongst them as a boon. Convicts had been a source of wealth to many; many hoped again to amass riches from their services; but Australia wanted them not. They could do without the introduction of British crime and its attendant - British Misery.
Mr. Lamb then came forward, proposed the form of Protest, and Mr. Lowe seconded the adoption of the Protest. He said that the stately presence of their city, the beautiful waters of their harbour, were this day again polluted with the presence of a floating hell - a convict ship. (Immense cheers.) In their port, they beheld a ship freighted, not with the comforts of life, not with the luxuries of civilised nations, not with commodities of commerce, in exchange for produce, but with the picked and selected criminals of Great Britain.
Mr. Henry Parkes said he belonged to the largest class of men in the colony - the working class. Let him ask, did the 1400 emigrants now afloat on the waters of Port Jackson, believe that when they left England, that they would find a convict ship in the midst of the vessels that conveyed them hither?
A deputation of twenty-three gentlemen went immediately to Government-house, but only six were admitted. These were informed by the Private Secretary that it would be necessary to forward a copy of the protest to the Governor, who would appoint a time to receive the deputation.
SECOND GREAT PROTEST MEETING
(Held Monday, 18th June, 1849.)
This Public Meeting was held to petition the Queen to remove Earl Grey from office and to pray that responsible government may be granted to the colony. It was attended by a large mass of people, numbering more than five thousand, and from all ranks and classes in society.
Mr. Robert Campbell was again called to the Chair Dr. Aaron now rose to move the first resolution petitioning her Majesty to remove Earl Grey from office. He spoke at some length. The resolution was seconded by Mr. Grant saying that the resolution had his hearty concurrence. Besides censuring Earl Grey, they ought to condemn the whole system of governing colonies through the intervention of the Colonial Office They ought to ask for the total abolition of the Colonial Office. It only existed to see that colonial legislation did not pass laws repugnant to Great Britain (Hear Hear.) He perceived that there was some talk of adding another link to the Colonial Office shackles by creating colonial titles. If he had any voice in the measure of this kind, his first step would be to create William Charles Wentworth, Duke of Lash and the Triangle. (Cheers and Laughter).
Mr. Lowe, who was received with enthusiastic cheering, then spoke. He was not disposed to say anything harsh against the present Governor of the colony. He did believe that gentleman to entertain a kind of languid and sickly sympathy with the colonists. He did believe that so long as he received his Â£100 a week of the colonists' money, that he was willing to accord with the opinions of the colonists, so long as by so doing he did not risk his reputation with his masters in Downing-street.
It should be remembered that the Governor had rescued Port Phillip from the infamy he was prepared to inflict on the people of Sydney - when he decreed that they should receive the convicts which had been sent by the home government. When the colonists assembled on Monday last in quiet, orderly and peaceable demeanour, what took place? The gates of His Excellency's palace were closed, a double military guard - the cavalry of the colony - the mounted police were quartered in the stables, and the kitchen of the house filled with soldiers. Did Sir Charles FitzRoy take them all to be robbers and murderers? He could say if he wanted to look for such characters, better to seek them on board the convict ship in the harbour. (Immense Cheering.) There was another ground, why he must say that great disrespect had been shown to the people, and it was this, that, out of a deputation of 23 gentlemen sent to Government-house by the meeting held last Monday, only six were admitted. What was the reason, was the Governor afraid of his silver spoons, or did he think the deputation would proceed to drink all the claret in the cellar?
