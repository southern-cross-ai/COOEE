Workmen whether unionist or non-unionist should in all cases be protected by officers of the law from anything approaching violence or forcible obstruction.
The present strike is connected with a state of things not necessarily unlawful in itself and not necessarily tending to breaches of the peace or specific offences against persons or property but in fact it has this tendency and is accompanied by incidents of this kind.
To secure to every man the liberty which is dear to him, to provide against the consequences of the present strike before more serious crimes take place and to bring to justice all those who have already offended against the criminal law this manual is prepared for general instruction. Justices of the Peace, Police, special constables and other officers of the law should carefully study the information given them with a view to repressing crime with firmness and discretion.
The primary offences embrace:
(1) Sureties of the Peace 
(2) Sureties for good behaviour
(3) Intimidation
(4) Unlawful assembly
(5) Going armed so as to cause fear.
(1) Sureties of the Peace
If any person complains in writing that he is in fear of some present or future danger to himself or to his property and that the public peace is likely to be endangered, any Justice has a discretion and duty to require sureties and may issue a Warrant in the first instance and unless satisfactory sureties are forthcoming may commit to gaol for any period not exceeding six months.
(3) Intimidation
This is at present the most common offence for which the measure of punishment is imprisonment with hard labour not exceeding three months. The law justifies a reasonable degree of moral persuasion or pressure and therefore would not punish a man who did not exceed the bounds of information and peaceable conversation but in its desire to protect persons and property of, and to secure liberty to, those who dissent even from a majority of their fellow workers it does not permit any person to use or threaten to use violence to another or to injure his property. It is the practice for numbers of persons to specially attend at roll calls having in some instances recently ridden from other sheds and either to beset the place of operations in a threatening manner or to use such language as coupled with the number of the picketing party is calculated to deter persons desirous of working from commencing operations. In such cases all concerned are guilty of intimidation and it would be right to then and there arrest the ringleaders in this collective and organized intimidation and convey them to the nearest lockup.
(4) Unlawful assembly
The definition of this offence is:
If 3 or more persons assemble together (1) with intent to commit a crime by open force or (2) with intent to carry out any common purpose lawful or unlawful in such a manner as to give firm and courageous persons in the neighbourhood reasonable ground to apprehend a breach of the peace in consequence of it, this constitutes an unlawful assembly. Instead of the shearers and others on strike going into camp and remaining peacefully there it is the practice on this occasion for men to congregate together in a number of camps with the object of sallying forth, some to intimidate at the various roll calls, others to picket the roads and avenues to employment and more to commit felonies of a more or less serious character.
These assemblies sometimes develop into Riots. ... If any Justice finds 12 or more persons assembled together and acting in a riotous or tumultuous manner he should read the  proclamation. ... and if further tumult continues should at once direct the Police to arrest the ringleaders. In case the circumstances call for it the Police will then act as an armed body and if called upon by the Justice it is their duty to obey. ... If rioters remain for one hour after the proclamation has been read they then become felons and should be dealt with as such.
In all the above offences constables should in endeavouring to arrest avoid as much as possible the use of firearms or other weapons but if in using the proper means for arresting or imprisoning they are resisted they may repel force by force and if death ensues in the struggle will be held harmless. 
So far these observations have only dealt with what may be considered primary offences or misdemeanours. It is a matter of common knowledge that felonies have followed on the above offences such as
(1) Assault and battery
(2) Malicious injuries to property
(3) Sheep and cattle stealing
(4) Unlawfully wounding
(5) Shooting with intent
(6) Arson of buildings or grass
(7) Murder
In these cases the Police have greater powers and may arrest without warrant. .. . In these cases they are armed to enable them successfully to overcome opposition to lawful arrests and to protect themselves against armed interference. It is their duty to arrest the felon as soon as they see him and if they cannot otherwise or secure him they must perform this duty even though they kill him and the law will protect them.
