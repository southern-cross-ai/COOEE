From time to time, since the commencement of the line to Echuca, attempts have been made by the workmen engaged on the line to obtain a rise of wages from 7s. per diem, the rate now paid by the contractors, to 8s. per diem, which the workmen think a more reasonable payment for their labour. Hitherto the efforts of the workmen have been unsuccessful, the demand for labour in the district having been of late comparatively slack. The opening up of a new field at the Raywood rush has been the cause of renewed dissatisfaction among the workmen, and seems to have induced a belief amongst them that an attempt to obtain a rise would at the present time prove successful. Under these circumstances, but little was required at any moment to cause a strike on the line. Nothing, however, appears to have been formally done for the purpose, and the present strike seems to have been more the result of accident than design. Yesterday morning, about half past nine o'clock, a labourer, named John Dynan, said to have been just discharged from the Sandhurst lockup, applied at the works, near Back Creek, to be taken on again, but at 8s. per diem. Being refused, he went to the men at the cutting and said to them, "Come out of that; I'll knock off your - heads if you work for 7s. a day." He was at once given into custody for interfering with the men. The result was much disturbance; several men got out of the cutting, and refused to go on working under 8s. per diem; and finally the whole of the men at work, about 100 in number, knocked off, and went down the line calling upon others to join them. At the Back Creek-bridge, in M'Ivorstreet, one of the men engaged at the crane refused to turn out, and offered to fight any man that would stand up to him. A rush was made at him from the bank by one of the mob, he was knocked down before he could put himself on his guard, and, either before or after he fell, struck between the eyes without, however, receiving any serious injury. Information of the proceedings was brought to the Town hall. The mayor adjourned the Police Court to twelve noon, and, accompanied by Mr. Cholmley, the inspector of police, and as many foot and mounted constables (eighteen of the foot-police...) as could be got together started for the Back Creek bridge. Meantime, the men continued their progress along the line. At the Crooked Billet, near Bridge-street, they found a body of masons at work; but, seeing a strong body of police coming, they passed on, and the masons continued their work. At the back of the White Hills, a gang of labourers at work there laid down their tools, as they saw the mob approaching, notwithstanding the presence of the police, who had orders to arrest any man who should interfere to prevent others working. Reinforced to about double their first number, the men on strike continued their progress as far as the commencement of Collier and Barry's sub contract, about the middle of the White Hills Hamlet, a distance of nearly three miles from the beginning of the line where the strike commenced. On the police reaching this point, inquiries were made of the contractors whether their men were being interfered with by the men on strike, and a reply being given that their presence interfered with the proper execution of the work, orders were given to clear the line.  Several of the men were taken into custody for abusive and threatening language to the ganger, and with some little difficulty the others were compelled to leave the neighbourhood of the works. The men engaged on them continued their labour, and the police remained on the spot to protect them from further interference. At this spot Mr. Higgins, the contractor, pointed out to the police a man who had been active in inducing others to commence the strike, who had threatened "to knock the legs from under him," and had said that he had "buried many a better man than him in Bruce's contract." He was at once taken into custody, and secured in the White Hills lock-up close by. The man who committed the assault at the Back Creek-bridge was not to be found. He is said to have slipped out of the mob immediately after committing the assault. The names of the men already arrested are John Dynan, Charles Crosby, Martin Macmahon, and John Nash.
