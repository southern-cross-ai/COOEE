So are we opposed to it if it is nonsensical, but as so many reforms and discoveries of incalculable value have at first sight been declared idiotic and absurd, we may as well look at the foundation facts and see if this proposed Bill contain the essence of foolishness or whether it does, as some claim, bring us as near to pure justice and absolute freedom as any human law has yet approached.
We are a community of men and women living in one corner of the globe which we have marked off as our own, and since the business of so many people cannot be managed by all, we select a hundred and fifty men to make laws for us and manage our public offices. The laws made by these deputies are binding on women as well as men, but the women have no advocates or representatives in the Assembly, nor any means of making their wishes known. The life and work of every woman is just as essential to the good of the community as that of every man. Her work and the character she bears raise or depress the standard of the state as much as does the life of any individual man; why is she set aside and disabled from expressing her opinion as to what should be done by this community of which she is a member. Why are her rights less than her brothers. She bears a full half of the trouble when the affairs of the state are depressed, an unjust law or the lack of law brings to her life care or hardship or injury as it does to men, yet none of the deputies ask what she wishes - why should they, she has no vote.  She belongs to the better behaved sex - for women only contribute one-fifth to the criminal class (four-fifths are men) and it would therefore seem likely that her opinion would be worth having, yet she is expressly discouraged from the formation of opinions, they are declared ineffectual by the other half of this community of people. It does not seem so nonsensical after all, this idea that a woman's opinion as to the fitness of a deputy may be as just and right and worthy of weight as a man's opinion.
Supposing 
There are two views of the woman's suffrage question commonly discussed, the justice of the measure, and its expediency. Few doubt its justice, many question its expediency, and yet, being just, what does all else matter?
Suppose that the right to vote lay with women only, and that the progress of the world was bringing expansive thoughts and hopes of a happier future into the minds of men. When men perceived that this right was unjustly withheld from them, and felt that their individual manhood was title enough to this right to a voice in decisions affecting all, would they tolerate discussion as to the expediency or wisdom of the measure. Would they stand by and hear the women conjecture how men might perchance misuse the concession if granted, would they quietly wait while political factions summed up the chances of the support of the new voters? No, they would say 'Curse you - it is my right. What business is it of yours how I use it?"
Her Proper Sphere
As to expediency the arguments have been so often repeated that it seems foolish to reiterate them especially as nothing cogent is brought forward on the opposing side. In Parliament such old phrases as these were used, viz: - that 'woman should be kept in her proper sphere" and "women have duties quite outside the political arena". One would think the political arena consisted of the Parliamentary Refreshment Room, they are so sure it is not a desirable place for a woman to be seen in. In the minds of these objectors "politics" seem to consist of the petty animosities and personalities which the law making business now gives rise to, but "politics" in reality cover nearly all questions which a thinking man or woman do now consider and form opinions upon. Laws are made upon divorce, the sale of liquor, factory regulations, the employment of children, gambling, education, hours of labour, and scores of subjects upon which women do think and respecting which they ought to have the power of giving effect to their wishes by the selection of men representing their shade of opinion.  And if women do not also at once enter the "political arena" so far as to care greatly about the land laws and mining acts, pray do men voters come to an intelligent decision on every possible subject of legislation before casting a vote? Most men do not seriously consider and decide in their own minds upon more than two or three of the many subjects which come within the wide circle of "politics", and it would not therefore take women long to reach equality in that respect. We are inclined to believe that a woman can form as good an idea as to the best man among Parliamentary candidates as the average man voter.
More Logic
But say some people, women do not want the vote, most of them would not use it if they had it. What will happen after they have the vote may be left to the prophets to say, but if A and B do not want something is that a reason why C who has a just claim should be denied?
Prematurity
In the debate, Mr Traill, who said he was in favour of woman's suffrage, urged that the measure would be premature; that women should be first educated to the use of a vote by possessing the suffrage under a Local Government Act. "Then," said he, "if found to be using it well they should be permitted to influence Imperial questions."
This would be kind indeed, but this is not the method hitherto employed when new classes have been admitted to the franchise. We have not first put them through political schools; we have taken the raw material, and under the influence of its new liberty and swayed by the responsibilities of its new standing, the raw material has developed, but where has any government ever had raw material so certain to act conscientiously, so prepared already with intelligence and with a strong bias towards moderation, peace, steady reform, and moral purgation? Probably it is because they know that with women voting the men of bad character would have little chance of future election, that makes men so fearful that women "might not use it well".
Women Members
Many of the speakers in the House contended that if women received the right to vote they should also logically have the right to sit in Parliament. This is not asked for and need not at present be decided. Few women would care for such a post, but it may be safely said that if exceptional women spring up such as the world has hitherto had some examples of, they could not fail to raise the tone of the House and fill a place worthily.  It is to be remembered that men will not cease to vote when women have the suffrage, and that women are decidedly critical of their own sex. She would need to be a remarkable woman who could win the confidence of a mixed constituency of men and women. A young married woman is the usual illustration taken to show the absurdity of a Woman Member and a woeful picture is drawn of her deserted babies and dinnerless husband, but these pictures only show the speaker's ignorance of women, for there is no woman who would not think of her baby and the happiness of her home long before she desired in her wildest fancies the barren honour of a Parliamentary seat. She would not be likely to be asked to stand, and she would not consent if asked.
Some members treated the question in the old semi-facetious way, conjecturing the effect of pretty women in Parliament and the power of a lovely woman Premier to win susceptible opposition members to her side. This presupposes that the political convictions of men are but wavering undecided beliefs, and easily unseated, and forgets this fact that a woman of such attainments and character that a mixed constituency of men and women esteemed her a fit Parliamentary representative, would by her very nature, her modesty and quiet sense, make this silly gallantry impossible, and she would so scorn adherents won only by beauty that they would probably begin under her influence to form their opinions firmly and honestly. Another member alleged that his brother members would do no work if ladies sat beside them. If men are indeed so silly that in a place of business they must inevitably be simpering to women, it will not be so nonsensical to give a vote to a class undoubtedly not prone to publicly exhibit their weakness or their foolishness.
METHOD 1890-91
No one who is  the habit of reading any of the many journals devoted to the interests of women, can have failed to be struck by the cry of overwork and overpressure which goes up from the hearts of women. From all parts, in varying accents and in different words, but with ever the same sad refrain comes the cry, "My burden is greater than I can bear; the ceaseless hurry and turmoil of my life is crushing me." And the pathetic part of it is that this is no complaint of idle, lazy women, but the expression of house mothers, workers, leaders in great and good works, whose energies are spent for the good of their families and of humanity at large, and who only desire that their burden may be lightened that they may do their work more faithfully. The cry goes up not alone from the poorer classes, it is echoed by women in every rank, through the length and breadth of the whole continent. That there is overpressure, is sadly and abundantly proved by the increasing numbers of women who are incapacitated by diseases of the nervous system, or who swell the roll of those poor souls who find an asylum within the walls of our hospitals for the insane.  Mr Bellamy has done what he could to stem the rising tide of household difficulties or rather to abate the flood which threatens to overwhelm so many homes, but women must understand that the real remedy lies with themselves.
Greater simplicity of life, dress, food and surrounding would at once mitigate, if not abolish the evil, and we may be very sure that men will not raise any strong objections if we lead the way. Indeed there are many who will welcome gladly the emancipation of their women-folk, and if we are honest with ourselves we shall at once own that most men prefer simplicity in dress, and that whatever may have been our reason for sitting up late, with aching back and eyes to put those two frills on little Irene's skirt or goffer our own flounces, it was certainly not to please the good man, who, though he likes his wife and children to look well dressed, is always on the side of plainness. So long as we all strive to live in the same style and to present the same appearance as our wealthier neighbours, so long will the house-mother have a tired face and a sharp or a weary tone in her voice, and the house-father but a small bank account. However as we cannot hope to hew down and root out in a few days or weeks the Upas tree of vain competition which has so long been growing in our midst, it may not be amiss to offer here a few suggestions which may prove useful to the overworked who see no way to lessen their labours.
After all, it is not the physical weakness which is the hardest to bear, but the constant strain on the memory that nothing shall be omitted and the continual attempt to do and think of two things at the same time. And here my suggestions may prove helpful. To ease the overburdened memory, try this simple plan; carry always in your pocket a small notebook and pencil and write down anything you want to remember to do, immediately you think of it, instead of turning your ring, or tying a knot in your handkerchief, or asking someone to remind you of it. Every morning as you dress have your little notebook open on the toilet-table and see what are the things to be done that day; like a wise general, plan your campaign before starting for the day's march. Train yourself to look in the little book when you have a few spare minutes, that you may see what is the most urgent duty.
Be sure to put down everything you wish to remember, letters to be written, visits to be made, little jobs of needlework or about the house, matters about which you wish to consult your husbands, orders for your servants and trade-people. Notes of invitation, etc., should always, when possible, be answered at once, so they will not need to be entered in your book. 
No woman with a bad memory, who has not tried the notebook system, can imagine the satisfaction it gives to run one's pencil through some line in the book and think comfortably "That is done and finished with." I do not propose the notebook as a panacea for all the troubles of overworked women, but it will certainly ease their labours to do their work more systematically. We should do well to lay to heart the precept of old George Herbert, whose wise and godly poems are not read half so much as they deserve to be, "Sum up at night the things that thou hast done, and in the morning what thou has to do."
If you have servants, write down on a slate the menu for the day, it helps them to remember and there can be no mistake. If you have no servant, still write out the menu and look at it as you prepare the meals, that you may have the things planned. It is well, in a spare half-hour, to gather together all one's cookery books and plan out the meals for a week; they can be modified afterwards to suit the contents of the larder and it simplifies the marketing and reduces the butcher's bill: there are so many inexpensive little dishes that are a welcome change from joints, chops and steak, but the existence of which one is apt to forget unless reminded by the cookery book.
If you have many garments to repair and not much time to devote to them, try the plan of giving one hour to preparing your work - matching materials from your piece-drawer, tacking on patches, cutting out, setting tucks, etc., then fold the prepared work neatly away, to be taken up at any moment, when chatting with a friend, when your husband is ready to read aloud to you in the evening or when you have a few minutes to spare. Much can be accomplished thus when it would be out of the question to devote the time and attention requisite for fixing the work. Look carefully over all linen which comes from the laundress and put aside all that requires mending, remember that the stitch in time neglected for one week often means two or three hundred the next.
Procrastination is not only, as we learned in our copy-book "the thief of time", it is also a chief factor in the sum of weariness, which oppresses many women. The writer having a natural tendency to that failing, knows from experience that the letter which should have been written and was not, the visit which was neglected in the proper time, tire one far more than letters written and visits paid. Here is one advantage of the notebook, it will not let one forget, and shames one into doing one's duty.
