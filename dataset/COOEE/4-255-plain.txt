But owing to the way that David had acted it changed the programme of affairs in many ways. 
I had a letter from James last night stating that David, his wife and her child had left where they were and had gone to New Zealand and they never thought worthwhile to let him know that they were going. David's wife wrote a note and sent it by a neighbour asking for the price of a small basin stand that they left there, at same time remarking that if he had not time to send a reply by bearer, not to write until she would write to him again. James wrote me on 20th and said they had left on Tuesday week which would be May 12th.  After all that James and Maggie has done for them she has not forgot to speak her mind pretty freely about Maggie especially and not in her favour and James also remarks that he is not all sorry that they left as her scandalous tongue would have done him a lot of harm in his business. I expect if they do not succeed in New Zealand that you will have them home with you soon.
