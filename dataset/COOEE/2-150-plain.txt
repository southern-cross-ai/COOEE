We have got a governess now. I like it much better than being at school, because I do not require to leave dear papa and mamma. I am learning to play the guitar; I found it very difficult at first. I made my fingers so sore and my arms ache, but now my fingers have got quite hard at the points, and I am getting on very well with it. I can play the accompaniment to "Ye Banks and Braes" and to "Ah Vous dirais", "Rondo", and a few other little airs. I am reading the history of England, and have got the length of James the First, who began the reign of the family of the Stuart's in England. I like my studies very much indeed; they are a pleasure to me. Miss Willis explains them as I go on, which makes them easy to be understood. I think I like geography better than any of my other lessons. I have gone through the four quarters of the globe with Miss Willis, and I begin again on Monday at the map of Europe and through each country, beginning at England. My sister gets on very well with her lessons. She writes very well indeed, and seems to have a great taste for drawing. She is also learning to play the guitar. I wrote to Grandmamma in December, and since then I have written to aunt Jane. They cannot have got my letters yet, and very much pleased I shall be if my aunt writes to me.
