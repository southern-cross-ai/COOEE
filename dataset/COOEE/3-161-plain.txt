My dearest Sister 
Your Kind letter and Parsel came safe to hand 15th October. I regreted very much not been able to answer it by return of post, but the mail made some little delay in Melburne so that the Australian mail left before the English one arived. 
I cannot express my delight when seeing yours and dear Thomases likeness, they were so Good. Do tell me when the were taken and where. I can carsely believe after seven or 9 long years I was to see you once more. I hope for my sake I shall see the reality some day. 
My dear Brother I fancy I see Him alive, I cannot believe he is gone, but I hope to meet him on a better Shore than even these Golden Shores. 
Tell dear Susan I was delighted with her Collar. I have never seen one like it. I shall be so carefull of wearing it lest I should wear it out soon which would grieve me very much. Also dear Edwards present, I have put it away for a particular ocation which I will tell him of some day. I intend writing to each one thanking them myself, but please tell them I prize them more coming from them than if I paid 30 / - for them here. 
I hope by this time dear Edward has read my note. I intend writing often if it is but a few lines, and I hope you will do the same, for it is cheering to think I have one Sister in the world, thou far from me yet ever dear to me, and your dear little ones also. Dear Matilda I intend sending my likeness per a Gentleman who is going home in december next. His Name is Mr. Charles Robin. I shall inclose his adress. He has promised to register the parsel in London so as to go safe. I thought it was a nice chance as I should hav to leave the end of the parsel open if I send it by Post here or pay letter weight which would be more than all is worth, but I should not mind that had I not this good chance. I send Edward a little Pocket Book with a letter and a soverin. He can please himself as to spending it. I have not thought yet what to send dear little Susan, but She shall have some thing to remember her Poor Aunt Bella. 
I shall write before you receive the parcel, so I shll then tell you the contents. I cannot think what I could Send you that you could prize. You have all the nice things and everythink won  could wish to get, but here nothing is new. I hope I shall some day see dear old Dublin again and its splendid shops and every thing ones heart could wish for, but it was not for me to be there when I was well off. All happened for the best. We cannot expect thinks to happen just as we like in this world. It would not be well for us if so, for we should likely forget ourselfs, and cling to close to this Vail of Tears. 
I was sorry to hear your dear Mother was not so well. I think it is well for her She has you with her, you do for her what no stranger would do. I soppose She is failing fast, you cannot expect her to last many years longer. I do trust when her change comes it will be a happy one. It will be a consolation to those she leaves behind. Give my very dear love to her. 
I soppose you would not think of coming to Australia while she lives. I hope times will be much better before you come. The never were much worse than the ar at present. There is such a dale of compition that some times you think the People would not let one another live if possable. I shall alway be able to let you know how things ar getting on before then so you will be able to Judge for your self. For my part nothing I should like better in this world, than to have you all near me and I have no doubt by industry you would do well, but as I have told you before it is all chance work. 
May God direct your steps which evr way he thinks best. He has guided me all through life, and I am sure he will you if you trust to him, altho alone without an earthly helping hand, you have him who has promised to be the Husband to the Widow, a friend to the friendless. I found a father and friend in him in a strange land and opend my private wary way, and when surround by danger and temtacion he was my shield. I trust my faith may never fail in him and may we all look to him who is the strong for Strength. 
Dear Sister I am still in the Times Drapery Mart, I cannot tell how much longer. Perhaps my next letter may say something. I cannot say any thing for sertain yet, but as far as Gault & Scott are conserned I may stay forever, for the would never give there consent to my leaving exept exept to better myself which I hope if I should it would be. I hope I would raise your curiousity, but I shall tell you all in my next which I hope will be next Mail. I am just as happy as evr no care. I some times think it cannot always last but I must not look at the dark side of things. We are doing a very good traede, I believe as Good as any in town. 
The anser to your question you will be Surprised to hear. I have got quite a Profisent hand at Milinery. I trim and make Bonnets. I trim plenty, but I have so litle time to spare to make I give most Bonnets out. It is all left to me just as I like. I like to sit some times to sew for a change, but I am continualy up & down serving customers. Mr. Scott has a Sister just come from Strabane in the North of Ireland, it maks it much more plesant for me to have a young person with me. She is about 29 years of age and a very nice Girl just lik her Brother a Good hearted Irash Girl. She knows nothing of the Drapery buisness being brought up on a farm. There is a large family of this home respectable farmers. 
Uncle is just getti on the same. I told you he got a Warrant Situation at one hundred per Year which is the best thing that has turned up for him yet for it is permt from 9 in the morning untill 5 or 6 I do not know which evening and every Saturday at one the close.  I hope he will soon get a raise as he anticipates. He has had a hard struggle to get on and bring his large family up respectably as he has done. The have Cows and Calvs and Hens and Ducks and I do not know what all, but I expect Aunt will enclose a note which will tell you all perticulars. 
November 9th 185
Dear Sister 
I thought I woul begin another apistel as I had a little more News to tell you. I dare say part of my letter will raise your curiosity, and as things have come to the point I must tell you I am engaged to Mr Scott you have often herd me speak of, as my cousin. Aunt E will tell you all about him rather I expect she will. I cannot Say more at present than He is one after my own heart, and in short words he is almost perfection in my estamation. 
If Aunt will not describe him I will when next I write. I promised to send you my likeness. I shall decline doing so Untill I send dear William and mine together. I know you will like to have them, both together. Perhaps I shall still send them by Mr. C. Robin, but I shll say in what way I shll send them by next Mail. I shll have  litle to tell you by next mail for the changes which is about to take place here. I do not know whether we shll stay here or not, it quite depends upon sercomstances. I shall write next month. I hope I shll hear from you evry month also. 
I did not intend writing much more, but this affair having taken place within the last fortnight, I thought I would gratify your curiosity. You were surprised to hear I was a Wesleyan but I soppose I shall sill be one as, my dear William is an out and out one, not only in Name but in heart and prinsable . My only prayer is that I may never be a stumbling block in the way for him, but that we may both go hand in hand in the name of Christ. It matters little in the Name as long as we ar named as the Children of God and even of the Guardians of Heaven. I some times wish we were all together here, but all is for the best, I hope we shall some day. 
Mr S and Sister ar from Drumclamph Co Tirone. I never met a nicer family since I came to this colony. You will see I was determined to have my own country man. It is the first offer I have had from an Irish man but plenty of English which I expect Aunt will tell you of but as I told you before I waited untill Mr Write would come and he has at last. 
I must not tax your pacience with this scribble any longer. I hope my next will be a more interesting one. Please give my very kind love to Uncle John and Aunt and all Family when you see them. Please tell them all, I am loning to hear from them. I send them a Paper almost every Month. I receive his also which is very kind of him not to forget me. Tell him or Aunt to write.  I send you a paper also Uncle, by this mail. I send you a Gold Shawl Pin for your self with a Nugget of Gold which answers for a head. I could not think what to send So I thought you woul like some thing colonia. If you will keep it for my sake as a token of love, I shll send what I promised by Mr C. Robin to Edward with Susan, for I can send nothing that I shoul wish to send by letter. I shll send Mr R adress by next mail. Please answer this by return of Post. 
Give my love to the dear Children and lots of Kisses. I soppose dear Edward will except this from his Poor Aunt. Give my Kind love to your dear Mother and all friends and except the same dear Matilda from your ever fond and Affection
