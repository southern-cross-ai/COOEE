White seemed labouring under the effects of recent dissipation, but presented, when peeled, a very fine appearance, and displayed more muscle and arm, and a smarter make than his opponent, who, however, though less elegant in shape, seemed exceedingly powerful; he was in splendid condition, and weighed ten pounds more than White. The friends of either party were very sweet upon their man. Six to five were freely given and taken, in large sums, on White; but, after the first round, even bets were liberally exchanged. There is a kind of nationality among the natives of the different colonies, that shews itself on occasions such as these. We doubt if a Sydney man would have wagered against the Sydney champion.
White fought in drawers, and loose Blucher boots; Bellamy in loose trousers, and without shoes. Both came up with pluck, and with every appearance of confidence. The fight was one of the best disputed, which can possibly be imagined. For the first four or five rounds the Sydney man had the best of it, and displayed superior strength, White having several heavy falls. In the third, the first blow was drawn from Bellamy, and in the fourth, the first knock-down blow was given to White, who also bled in the sixth. At this time, White commenced fighting 'points', as it is termed, and 'dropping'. In the thirty-fourth, he was panting for breath, and Bellamy was perfectly fresh, but in the thirty-seventh the latter staggered, and seemed to fall weakly. In the fifty-first, White was thrown by a blow protested against as foul, but it was justified by the umpires. The longest round was the fifty-seventh, which occupied two minutes, the rest ranging from three quarters of a minute to a minute: it ended by White's being thrown, and his head coming violently on the ground. In the next, there was a terrific rally, and White went down again. The heaviest fall in the fight was endured by the same person in the sixty-first round, and every one was surprised to see him come to time again. From the sixty-third to the sixty fifth round, both men appeared very weak, and Bellamy was almost blind: but, when the sixty-fifth was called, bets were still equal, and no idea was entertained that the fight was at an end.  It was so, however; White, who had all along 'butted' as opportunity offered, caught Bellamy with his head between the chin and the chest, who sprang slightly from the ground, and fell completely overpowered.
Thus ended one of the sharpest and best-contested fights which the lovers of the ring remember to have seen. It occupied one hour and thirty-five minutes: half-minute time.  Both men were dreadfully knocked about, but it is agreed on all hands that the whole was fair. It could not be denied that, though the Sydney man was beaten, he proved himself a fine fellow. A collection, amounting to £10, was made for him on the ground. From a hundred to a hundred and fifty persons were present, and much more than at the rate of a pound a-head is said to have changed hands. The whole went off in perfect quietness and good humour. In the sixty-six rounds, White was down fifty-three times, Bellamy seven, and both men six. This is sufficient to show the different style of the two men's fighting.
