We use Australian in its fullest, truest, broadest sense. To us it conveys an idea which we cannot adequately describe; a something far different from a vain and sectional clamour for the right to run amuck among the brawling nations of foreign lands, and to strike for conquests where we cannot rule; a something that may not be expressed in words and that is as yet outlined only by the spasmodic leapings of an embryonic sentiment The Australian national movement is the setting in of one of those periodic tides which change and alter the whole life of the human race, it is the first pulsation of another of that series of upheavals which through countless cycles of evolution-phases have uplifted the senseless cell of protoplasmic life to the exalted station whereon the white man stands. It is in Australia that the battle against Nature's brutal laws will be fought out; it is here in Australia that human society will develop itself and that the yet unanswered riddles of the Sphinx will be finally solved.
We are for this Australia, for the nationality that is creeping to the verge of being, for the progressive people that is just plucking aside the curtain that veils its fate. Behind us lies the Past with its crashing empires, its falling thrones, its dotard races; before us lies the Future into which Australia is plunging, this Australia of ours that burns with the feverish energy of youth, and that is wise with the wisdom for which ten thousand generations have suffered and toiled. 
We are for Australia, for that which will work her weal, against that which will work her woe. We yield no other allegiance, profess no other loyalty; we recognise no duty as owing to authors, we set above all other claims the claims of our own land.
These then are our principles from which we trust to swerve not; these being our principles, it is impossible to lay down any hard and fast rules of conduct or any set political course. Party politics to us are nothing, for we have no party. We are for measures,- not men, for such measures as will tend to mould aright the destinies of the Australian people.
Australia is not a sect or a section, it is not a caste or a class, or a creed, is not to be a Southern England nor yet another United States. Australia is the whole white people of this great continent, without distinction of sex, age, or previous condition, and the Australian policy is a continuance in that enlightenment which has already proved her, while still in the colonial Stage, foremost among the states of the earth. This preeminence has not been won by aping the forms and fashions of other climes; it has been gained by disregard regard for precedence and custom, and by exercising without trammel the intellect which alone is worthy of heed. It is this untrammelled intellect to which we must look for good, to thought that is free from the slightest taint of fear, to criticism that does not halt before those who sit in high places, and to ridicule that does not weaken because the superstitions it may attack are deeply rooted. And while thus devoting its political efforts to the furtherance of this one all-embracing principle, the Boomerang will endeavour in every way to aid the national spirit that is so sturdily developing. Its illustrations will be Australian; its stories and its sketches will be Australian; its humour will be Australian; and its articles and comments will tend to Australianise. Finally, its existence will demonstrate that Queensland, the youngest and brightest of the Australian group, is prepared in journalism as in all other matters to claim at least equality with her sister colonies in the South.
