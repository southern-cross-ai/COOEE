We saw Miss Aicken. She looks in very good health. We have a good feed of strawberries and other fruit. I commenced on Friday last 7th December and when I was leaving Mr Agnew in the street he again invited us to go out a second Sunday, also a Mr Brown from Co. Down who he was also trying to get into a situation but Brown went to a situation in a country town about 200 miles from here so John and I went ourselves and enjoyed a pleasant evening. We also went to his pew in the church he goes to in Melbourne. His residence minds me of some of the house you would see up in the Malone Road (Belfast) with their lawn before the door and nicely laid out ground but in the Australian fashion with veranda etc. He has four nice little cobs or rather ponies. He drives one of them in town when going about business to the bank etc. His business is a Coach builders Ironmonger not coach builder and ironmonger. He proposed to give John a letter of introduction to a farmer he knows if John does not like to stay where he is gone.
