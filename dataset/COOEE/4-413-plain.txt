Anyone who will take the trouble to compare the course of proceeding followed in our Supreme Court in an action at law, with that of our Local Courts, cannot fail to be struck by the immense superiority of the latter over the former. In the Supreme Court it may safely be asserted that no layman has yet ventured to draw his own pleadings and conduct his own case till ripe for trial without professional assistance. Few, indeed, are the instances in which a suitor has had the hardihood or the confidence to conduct the trial of his own case. In the Local Courts there is nothing in the practice to prevent every man from being his own lawyer. Persons frequently issue their own summonses and conduct their own cases without any help whatever from legal men. In the Supreme Court the costs on both sides attendant upon the trial of a cause can hardly be estimated at less than £100. Frequently they amount to between £300 and £400, and the sad experience of suitors will confirm the statement that even this latter sum cannot be taken as an extreme limit. In the Local Courts the cost of a similar action may be estimated at a sum varying according to the amount in dispute  -  between a few shillings and £20. But the most striking feature of the suggested comparison has yet to be noticed  -  the difference between the two tribunals in the all-important matter of the time elapsing between the commencement and final determination of the proceedings.
In the Local Court a plaintiff may reasonably expect to reap the fruits of a successful action within a month  -  that is, provided there is no appeal to the Supreme Court. Should a Local Court suitor be drawn by an appeal to the higher court, its cumbrous and wearisome proceedings may extend the time by some two or three months  -  a delay vexatious enough, it must be confessed, but far preferable to the ordinary course of a Supreme Court action, which we will now consider.
A suitor in the Supreme Court may deem himself most fortunate if, in spite of the delays in pleading, he brings his cause to trial in six weeks from the issue of the writ. More often than not this interval may be reckoned by months instead of weeks. After the trial the much abused practice of obtaining a rule nisi upon every conceivable point that technical ingenuity can suggest comes into play. After the granting of the rule nisi a considerable time elapses before the argument  -  a time which cannot be estimated even approximately. Anything is seized hold of and admitted as an excuse for delay here; a marriage and death in the family of either counsel or of one of the judges seems to be quite a legitimate ground for putting off the cause. Then when at length the argument is concluded, the judgment is commonly reserved, and another interval occurs, which may be calculated at from one to eighteen months, before the final judgment is given, unless indeed the cause itself dies out, as has sometimes happened, in which case the judgment is never given at all. If the rule nisi is made absolute the delays are again repeated, till many a disappointed and purse-exhausted suitor is driven into the Insolvent Court  -  a step which invokes ideas of wretchedness, not only to the suitor, but to his wife and children, too distressing to be here dilated upon. 
It need perhaps hardly be said that this comparison is designed solely to bring into a popular view the defects of procedure attendant upon remedies sought in the Supreme Court, and is in no wise intended as disrespectful to the judges, who administer an imperfect system.
In view of all these advantages possessed by the Local Courts, it is evident that an extension of their present limited jurisdiction would be a most desirable instalment of law reform. It would relieve the Supreme Court of a large number of the smaller cases now necessarily subject to that tribunal. It would tend towards that bringing of justice to every man's door, so desiderated by earnest law reformers. Rich men having heavy interests at stake might still indulge in the luxury of a Supreme Court action, but these are just the persons and these are just the interests which can best afford the prolixity and expense of that form of proceeding. Poorer individuals, to whom that prolixity and expense are simply ruinous, would find cheap and expeditious justice in the inferior tribunals, instead of being, as now, compelled into buying justice too dearly in the higher court. In short, every reason which can be found in support of the creation and existence of Local Courts at all, may fairly be urged in aid of the extension of their jurisdiction. The lawyers might suffer, and no doubt will find objections; but the interest of the general body of the public being involved, there remains scarcely a doubt that when the community awake to a sense of the advantages they will obtain by the proposed amendment, a Bill to enlarge the jurisdiction of the Local Courts will meet with unqualified approval.
