Mr. Graham has got into a situation long since but I don't know that he likes the country. You know he is a married man and has a wife and two children which will no doubt make him home sick. However, let that be as it may, it should not be the means of giving him a bad impression of the country. We all have our home ties which is inseparable. At the same this country is not to be compared with home as far as business and in fact all industries are concerned. 
Mr. Graham called with me the next morning after he arrived. I had a long chat with him. He left me to go and see a second cousin, who came out with John and Hugh. This cousin (lives in Richmond about 4 miles from Melbourne) told him of a job which he went about and got. I advised him to go to the country but he preferred staying in Melbourne and suburbs.
