 rain is very much wanted as grass is very scarce in this northern district of Victoria. Besides ploughing cannot well be carried on till the ground has been softened by a good fall of rain times are very dull in Australia at present. Melbourne in particular is in a bad state and things are expected to be worse during the coming winter.  There has been a season of prosperity but it was not quite real prosperity. There has been over-speculation in many ways especially in land and building. Then there was the great strike and there has been many failures of financial institutions. Indeed things will be in a bad state for some little time to come. This would be a very bad time for anyone to come to Victoria for one has to know the ropes to get along or obtain employment. There is to be great retrenchment by the new government which will shortly be elected as the governments of the last six years have been spending money far too fast. In fact the whole family of the Victorian people are on the saving lines at present or in other words are whipping the cat. Well it is natural after all for a country any more than an individual cannot spend more than it earns and at the same time keep its head above water
