The evergreen forests of Australia are so very different to the home woods (when one does at home come to a wood which is so very seldom) then the dead trees which have been run to let the grass grow have such a weird desolate appearance. The scenery here does not come up to the home scenery generally, as far as I have seen at any rate. Of course art has done more for that of the home countries than it has yet accomplished for Australia
