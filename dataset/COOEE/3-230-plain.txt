Dear Sir
I take the liberty of adressing you with these few lines and you may think I am bold perhaps but as I am so fixed at present, I can hardly help it. And the boldness I make is that if my Brother and Sister is Coming away if you will be Kind enough to send me about twelve yards of the best flannel you have as price will be no obstickle as also the same of the best white moleskin as we cannot get any of a good quality here. 
And if you will be so Kind as to Suply them with any thing that they may be Short of, as I had not much Cash to Send at this time to make them ready and by forewarding an account of the same I will Send you the money the first I receive from New Zealand or when they come home at the fartherst. And if you would be so Kind as do any writing which they may have to do for them as you will understand better what to do or where to send to than them, I may have the chance to recompence you for truble expence &c. yet or I am sure Johnney will if he is Spared to return safe. 
As I have been sending all the perticulars of how they are doing in New Zealand in my Fathers letter it is allmost likly you will see them so I need not write them here. 
I have received several papers from you for which I am much obliged. I am also very much obliged to you for all the truble you have taken in former times with us and our friends and I think you will not shrink at this time as you seem very anxious to see as many off as possable. I will send you a paper by this mail. Also give my best respects to your Father & Mother and accept the Kindest regards of your friend 
Mary McMillan 
Dear Sir I received your very welcome letter by this mail also but having a good deal to write this time I cannot reply to it this time. So exuse your friend and wellwisher
