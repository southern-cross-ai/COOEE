Selbourne Chambers,
Pirie Street, Adelaide,
October 23rd, 1896.
Sir, - 
I have the honor to acknowledge the courteous invitation of the Bathurst Federation League to be present at the People's Federal Convention to be held in your city on the 16th November next, and to be the guest of the Committee of your League whilst there, and I beg that you will convey to your League my grateful appreciation of the honor done me, and my deep regret that I am unable to accept the invitation.
May I, however, be allowed to add my warmest wishes for the success of the gathering, and my earnest hope that not only as an educational, but also as a stimulating force, it may more than satisfy the anticipation of the League under whose auspices it has been organised. The Federal question must be kept in the public eye as well as the public mind. Demonstrations such as yours will do both. Agitation is as needed for Federation as for any other people's question. It is in that respect and within that limit that your gathering will attract universal attention and be watched with keen and widespread interest.  And I trust when it disperses it will leave such a record of judicious and salutary work as may induce wise and earnest Federalists elsewhere to consider whether the footsteps of Bathurst may not be followed with advantage. Permit me to remain, Very faithfully yours,
J. H. SYMON,
President of the Federation League of South Australia.
P.S. - May I say that if later on I find my engagements for November will enable me to be present at your Conference, I shall not hesitate to take the liberty, still regarding your invitation as open to me.
The Organising Secretary, People's Federal Convention, Bathurst, N.S.W.
