THE MANY robberies which have lately been committed render it necessary that some steps should be taken to put a stop to a practice so destructive of the happiness and comfort of the industrious. And as it is well known that a fellow known by the name of Black Caesar has absented himself some time past from hit work, and has carried with him a musquet, notice is hereby given that whoever shall secure this man Black Caesar and bring him in with his arms shall receive as a reward five gallons of spirits.
The Governor thinks it further necessary to inform those settlers or people employed in shooting, who may have been occasionally supplied with powder and shot, that if it shall be discovered hereafter that they have so abus'd the confidence placed in them as to supply those common plunderers with any part of their ammunition, steps will be taken immediately for their punishment, as they will be considered accomplices in the robberies committed by those whom they have so supplied.
