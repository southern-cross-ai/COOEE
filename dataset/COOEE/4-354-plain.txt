Supreme Court, Victoria,
5th November, 1896.
Thos. A. Machattie, Esq.
Dear Sir, 
I received your kind letter of date October intimating to me the intention to hold at Bathurst a Convention of the people with a view to advance the achievement of the Federation of the Australian colonies, and expressing the belief that if I should deem it proper to express my concurrence in and sympathy with the, movement, my doing so would be of some assistance to it. I cannot but feel much honoured that you, and those associated with you, should think that my opinion could thus weigh with your people, and I thank you for the expression of that belief.
I have no difficulty in complying with your request, both because, I have the, to me, very gratifying honour to hold the office of President of the Federation League of Victoria, and because, in my opinion, the Federation of these colonies is the greatest consummation which patriotic feeling can dictate, or statesmanship contrive, for the material interests of our Australian people and for the elevation and advancement of them. It is, moreover, a matter so broad and obvious in its utility as to be practically above the mere contests of partisan politics, and therefore one can be sure that the judicial office will not be hurt by even much earnestness in supporting this great movement.
For these reasons I do most heartily commend the well conceived effort which your people are making to aid it, because, when the body of the people see its undoubted value, it will be as good as accomplished.  Meanwhile, and until they do so, the efforts of the rest cannot effect much. 
I wish your Convention every success, and if anything which I could say will aid it, count me whole-souled and unreservedly with you. 
I have the honour to be, dear Sir, 
JOHN MADDEN, C.J., Victoria.
