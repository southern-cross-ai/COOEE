Her father was a ship merchant now dead in India and an uncle was executor for the widow and family and he robbed the orphans and they had to go out as governesses. They being able to read music and two or three languages; one of them is master of five different languages. She is a very nice quiet girl with dark eyes and brown hair plump cheeks and always a smile playing about face and seems healthy looking. She is a great favourite of Sarah's.
