If she sees I take pleasure in anything she tries to also, to have our pleasure mutual. A wife is something more than a beautiful  figure. A wife ought to be a helpmeet not only for this world but for the world to come. Again if you see a girl that you think would suit you and be slow to make up your mind on that point, be very sure of it, try and calmly and dispassionately weigh both your own and her disposition and see if they will balance but having done so and come to the conclusion that they will, do not let any false feeling of pride keep you from getting married because you cannot start where your or her parents leave off. We have to crawl before we can walk and no girl is worth marrying who is not willing to start with her husband at the foot of the ladder and help him to climb it rung by rung until he is in a position to give her many things that she has had to do without but against his will. It is a mistake I think for men or women to delay marrying. The longer the delay the more fixed and formed the habits of life are and the more difficult it is to form a real amalgamation. Like two young trees when young, you can twine them round and round each other but in a few years if not united they will grow nearer and nearer but they will never unite like they would in their young days. Again you cannot know the happiness that is to be enjoyed in knowing that there is one being dependent upon you who loves you better than all the world beside and whose interest is yours and yours is hers. I wish I had married five years sooner.
