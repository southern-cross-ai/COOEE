And William Carmody and his mother are taking their long rest in the chapel yard - When I think of old times, in my own School days and think of friends & companions so widely dissevered - some by the wide ocean and others by the wider barrier of the grave, it makes me melancholy enough. But - I Know the world well by this. There is scarcely a hue in the broad curve embraced by its ups & downs that is not familiar to me although I am very young. And I can always console myself, by recurrence to my short but bitter experience Of life - we are all on a preparatory stage for another life, and our ills and woes in this world must be met with a bold and fearless face either to conquer them or if that is beyond our reach, why the common and only alternative of man remains. 
It gave me pleasure to hear that crops were good for last year, the poor old country wants some thing to Keep it from being entirely depopulated. 
I cannot send you my photograph by this mail as there is no chance of getting it done at present in Wangaratta. Sharry is removed from Beechworth - he is now in Geelong. I saw him about a fortnight ago, when he was going down by coach, to Melbourne. He & Mrs Sharry are very well. 
You did not mention how my fathers health was. I expected him to write a few lines to me. I did not hear from any of the Combers in Geelong this time past. I will write to Mary soon. The saddling is a good trade for Michael. It does splendidly in this country. How is my grand mother & uncle James. Remember me to all friends - with Kind love to my Father & brothers and Sisters 
I remain your affectionate Son
