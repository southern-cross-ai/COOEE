Clearing 5 acres entirely at £10 £50
Cutting black boys and ring-barking 950 acres at 5s. 0d. £237 10s. 0d.
Fencing 22 miles wire netting at 10s. 0d. per chain £80 0s. 0d.
Shed with lean-to 30 foot long 14 feet wide 12 foot high £32 10s. 0d.
Total £400 0s. 0d. 
 I feel the want of a little capital awfully as I have any amount of grass going to waste and could buy stock and fatten at an average profit of £2 per head at least. I am also stuck for a house. I could build a very decent four-room cottage (one storey of course) for £100, chiefly of timber. Matrimony might then be considered and the kids you mention duly counted before they were hatched. There is very little trouble here in bringing up youngsters. They earn their tucker I can assure you, as soon as they can ride and muster stock. I am afraid no Clogher money will come our way; those Dungannon sharks will take care of that. However, with help and luck I should be a prosperous man in ten years. 
Could you not send me out a nice little Irish girl with a small fortune? The life is a glorious one. A man can grow all he wants and a woman has little to do and no conventionalities to study. It would have suited a wild little monkey like you to rights. 
My orchard looks well and I expect some few apples next year. I have ripe cherries now!  Working horses are very dear here and horse and cart costs, the horse £25 and the cart and harness £22; these are the lowest. At present I borrow from my neighbours. I am working now harder than ever in my life before ring-barking.
