I could do well if I had enough to stock my paddock when it is fenced and ring-barked as meat is 8d. and 9d. a lb. in the towns now owing to the duty on imported stock and the dread cattle tick (ixodes bovis) has made its appearance in the North. Kangaroos are plentiful now and I can get one anytime in an hour or two. But ducks are breeding and I won't shoot them  I have the makings of a very pretty place if I can only get over the first three years I will be all right. I am getting a bit scared. I have to raise Â£25 a year rent. I would have only taken up half the quantity of land but was afraid of its being selected all round me and I was right too, as it has been taken up on three sides already and a man can't make a living off less than 1,000 acres that is grazing. If I can get other people's stock to fatten in my paddock I can raise the rent that way as they are giving good rent for paddocks. But I suppose I'll get through all OK so won't despair. 
Carrie is going to send me out some papers regularly and I wish you would try and do the same. If you were here for a week you would know what it was to be without anything to read in the evenings and no one to talk to.
