My dear Patrick,
I delayed replying to your letter in hopes that I should be able to say something as to your wishes of exchanging your Grant of Land to the Coal River but I am still unable to say anything decisive as Oxley is unwell and the Govt. seem undetermined as to the proper mode of proceeding. It occurs to me however that the best way will be for you to memorial for a Grant putting the land received from Sir Thomas Brisbane down as for Charles and Dalmahoy and if you can get it it will be an advantage, if not you will still have your share of what is up here but I shall be able soon I hope to say something more decisive and shall write you as soon as possible in the mean time you may be on the look out for a track that would answer and perhaps we might as well relinguish what we have up here and take all down at the Coal River but of this hereafter.
I have got your pay and taken up the Bill to MacVittie. I did not ask him to renew it but if you have particular occasion for money send up a Bill the same as the last we signed and I will try to get it discounted for such sum as you require but if you can do without it you had better as you will save the interest.
I had a letter from John. He is well but William has been ill and he says we may expect him down here. John has got a good situation if he has his health, he will do well. He is in the Nizams Civil Service and has 1200 Rupees a month beside his pay as a Lieut. and Rank going on. He says he is now within two of the top of the Lieuts. William has not been so lucky poor fellow. He has got no appointment yet.
This day I got a letter from your Aunt Barbara but it is of an old date and directed to your Sister Colin. She says she had written to me but I have not got it if she did. She says all our friends in the Highlands are well.
I shall write again when I come here next week. Margaret takes up school at Parramatta in eight or ten days. In haste.
I am my dear Patrick, Your affectionate Father, John Campbell
