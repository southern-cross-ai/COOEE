My Dear Sir,
I wrote to you by the Emu that sailed for Port Jackson on the 19th  and enclosed a letter to Sarah Baker which I will be much obliged to you to send to her, she lives in the same row as Capt. Shawe and I hope will be easily found.
I am very unpleasantly situated here, and it is in vain for me to attempt to do the duty until a more regular system is adopted. I am however on the best terms with the Lieut. Governor and, as things are, endeavour to make the best of it. I must rely on you for advice and assistance, and I beg you will not withhold it from me. - As I mentioned before I can get nothing from Mr. Gordon, and the little I have sufficiently proves his incorrectness which I trust will never appear against me.
You will much oblige me by sending a printed form of the report that is made to the Governor on the arrival of a Ship, a Copy of each of the Bonds, with a form of the accounts and any information or method you could suggest for me to keep them that would enable me to carry on the duty with correctness and facility I should be most particularly obliged to you for. I would also beg a list of fees, and those that the Naval Officer is entitled to, any remarks that may occur to you respecting the Duties I will thank you for. I would not have taken this liberty if I had not been convinced of your friendship and desire to serve me from the politeness and attention both Mrs. Drummond and myself received from you during our stay at Sydney and in complying with the request I have made I assure you it will be doing me a favor. I felt a delicacy in speaking to you on the subject, but as Mr. Oblott has assessed in the same manner to Mr. Bond and received from him every advice and information I see no reason why I should suffer for want of applying to who is ever ready to oblige their friends as you are.
I am quite satisfied with the climate and Country it is certainly far superior to that of Port Jackson, but the people are infinitely worse but I confidently hope everything will soon be put on a regular plan, I cannot say what I could wish, but apply to Capt. J and you may safely rely on what he tells you; in saying this I tell you a great deal having myself heard him.
I shall not give you much trouble to procure a horse for me: The small houses I am in being £50 a year, and every necessary of life most exorbitantly dear, indeed it will require an yearly income of £500 to support my family.
There is an excellent opportunity of writing to England by the Jefferson whaler that will go  in a week, had we known of it at Sydney it would have been advisable to send your letters here.
Our society here is very small, none of the ladies having called on Mrs. Drummond but Mrs. Davey and Mrs. Gordon which is very fortunate for there are not any others that I could have associated with for some reason; Mrs. Hogan is a genteel woman, but he has an unfortunate habit of taking an extra glass, and in that case is sure to insult you, for which reason I believe few if any of the Gentlemen associate with him.
The System of drinking is such here that I am obliged to keep very much to myself as I both dislike it and cannot afford it, it has prevented me from having many of them with me for no other reason. Mr. and Mrs. Abbott and ourselves were constantly together and he is now more frequently with us, which is society enough for me.
Mrs. Drummond and her sisters enjoy good health, they desire their kindest regards to you, and your little godson is thriving quite to our wishes.
I beg you will remember us most kindly to Mrs. McArthur and family, Sir, John Jameson and all enquiring friends. I will thank you to forward any parcels or letters by the first opportunity and to take charge of any thing that may arrive from England for me.
I am with great regard, My Dear Sir, Your sincere friend, John Drummond
