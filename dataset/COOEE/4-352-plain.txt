Sir, 
I am desired by His Excellency Viscount Gormanston to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 31st ultimo, inviting the expression of his sentiments in regard to the People's Federal Convention to be held this month at Bathurst. Whilst viewing with satisfaction and sympathy any scheme having for its object the promotion of the Federation of the Australian colonies, His Excellency desires me to say that he must leave any further expression of the views entertained by this colony to the delegates who, he understands, have been invited to represent Tasmania at the forthcoming Convention.
I have the honor to be, Sir,
Your most obedient Servant,
J. F. ALEXANDER RAWLINSON,
