My dearest Papa,
This will be a large packet containing my journal of our trip to the Northward. I wrote you on the 16th of April (the day on which I received the parcel) and also on the 2nd of May. Your last letter is the one which came in the parcel dated Sept. 26th 1850.
You will perceive that my journey was rather an anxious undertaking, it has terminated well thanks to a superintending Providence. I have great delight in being with the Children once more.
I enclose a letter of the Governor's commenting upon the journal etc. and it would tend further to complete my satisfaction if I could hear also that you approve of my conduct not only in this particular but generally in the circumstances in which I have been placed since leaving my kindred and Native Country. 
A good prospect seems opening up to us in every way now, an establishment is forming at the North that is likely to be carried on upon an extensive and profitable scale. It is most likely we shall all go there, for a time at least, but as yet it is by no means certain. I hope and trust dearest Papa your valuable life will be long preserved and that you will yet have the satisfaction of seeing us go on to your heart's content. Honors have fallen upon us more than I could have expected, as yet they are empty ones not having filled the pockets; neither have they diminished aught. On the whole I think we must be in safe circumstances all having been kept together and now every thing is increasing so much in value.
Mr. Brown has got very handsomely out of the Council after having sat one session, his removal to the Northward is the pretext, his letter to the Governor tendering his resignation was answered by complimentary regrets at losing him, he stands fairer than ever now for a Govt. berth, and our receiving this is one thing it would rejoice me to communicate to you. You will rightly guess what would give us still greater joy than that, which if our proposals are complied with is near an accomplishment.
I will close this letter with expressions of my gratitude for your domestic readings, the only kind of education that ever  the least good and which I hope I have been able to profit by though perhaps not to the full extent I ought to have done.
Dearest Papa
Yours most Affectionately
Eliza Brown
P.S. To my Sisters Anna, Mary, and Emma I have not written for an age. I do hope they see your letters. I am very anxious to hear about Emma considering the event that was anticipated when I last heard. I have not forgotten the little Eliza and have something to say to you about her bye and bye. Is my poor dear Aunt in the land of the living? Bussel re-established in health? do not fail to answer these inquiries. E.B.
