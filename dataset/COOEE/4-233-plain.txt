I think they will grow well enough on the ground where you had the potatoes last year as they are a different kind of crop. I want you to dig round the fruit trees and sow the rape a few feet round; then when it has grown 8 or 10 inches dig it down for manure. If there is any part of the garden where you do not want to plant other seeds or crop throw a few seeds of the rape about and when growing down it is a splendid green manure. 
We have decided not to charge you anything for the garden for last year nor for the incoming year. The only conditions are that you dig around trees and sow rape as above stated. A few peas sown among the rape also makes a good manure but you had better keep the peas for use. Try some new ground for a few potatoes. Throw wood ashes where you plant the peas also horse dung if there is any  
You are right in boarding your man. Then you have any little benefit there is from the milk and the garden. But I would advise you to make arrangements with him to pay him only for the  he is working. You cannot afford to pay him for wet days when he is loafing about the hut. It is quite enough for you to feed him on such occasions. Be sure you make these arrangements before he starts work with you. If he does not like that let him go. You could keep on the young fellow for a little while at any rate but should the weather set in wet I do not think you would be wise in keeping him as there would be too much broken time. Keep up your heart the block will come in useful to you yet. Don't ring every tree it takes too much time; leave a good few here and there; at some future time you could go through them  besides you make a bigger show for your work. Leave the good straight trees. 
You will be glad to know that I am to be married on the 31st of this month God willing. If the journey was not so great we would go the length of the Crossing  are there any neighbours to erect half of your dividing fences. I mean those on adjoining blocks and yours
