So I am going to stake all and even my life in a big venture. Never venture, never win you know. I am off to Coolgardie Gold Fields as soon as the rain starts. I am at present engaged getting three other fellows to join me, all men I know to be honest and sober and above all men inured to hardships and bush life and good bushmen. There are dozens of parties which have never been heard of which have gone out prospecting and, never having been accustomed to bushing it, have got lost. If a man makes one mistake it is his last, so one wants to be careful. I think one of my mates has something good already. He went up last year and found a chain of fresh lakes evidently permanent and close by found some specks or colours in a reef. He had no rations and his mate was sick so he had to return. 
The intermediate country is utterly devoid of water except at certain times so we must wait for the rain which may come anytime now but most likely about April or May. The man who found this is named Bussell and is from a very old Colonial family who founded one of our principal towns Busselton. His estate is highly mortgaged and he is on his last legs. His brother went up with a chap I know well named Dawson and they have made their fortunes. Dawson's brother, J. Bussell, A Heppingstone and I are the four, if nothing happens. Bussell and Heppingstone are related and Lancey Dawson and I are old chums and might be related someday. All three are good honest gentlemen.
