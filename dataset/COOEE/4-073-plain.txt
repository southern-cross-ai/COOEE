 we are now lodging with Mrs. McDonnell. We can manage to live cheaper at least my bill is more reasonable than when I was stopping in the other place. John and I have taken to porridge in the evening and find a great benefit from it. Mr. McVicker had a walk out with us on Sunday, indeed the last two Sundays. He has been here several times in the evening. Of course he is a little lonely and we are great company to him. He is getting along nicely in his situation. He got the same salary as myself to start with but he thinks he will never have such fine times again as when in J. R's  Mr George Reid called with me a fortnight ago. His father and Hugh were pegging out some land for selection but do not know if they will get it, as some others were pegging out too  
John has improved a good deal since he came to Melbourne. He is much heavier. I don't think Queensland is much of a place to go to as there are a great lot of immigrants continually arriving there and can't all get work; besides black labour cheapens white. You see the farmers and squatters return the members of Parliament and they only return those who will vote for free immigration so that they can get their work done cheaper. There is a good deal in the papers about the unemployed in Brisbane as well as the capitals of the other colonies.
