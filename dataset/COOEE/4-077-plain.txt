It was he engaged me and indeed engages all the hands, of course with the other's opinion on the matter. He is liked better by most of the hands that I have heard expressing an opinion. The other is a whimsical old fellow and as some of the hands say, you don't know when you have or when you haven't him; is rather hard to please at times and sometimes get through a good many strange hands. There has been many come and left since I went there. I often think of turning to the farming, when bothered or annoyed about something or other but dearie knows I might turn farmer along with John some time; hard to say what's before us.
