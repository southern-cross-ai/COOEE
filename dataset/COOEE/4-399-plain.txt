To the Queen's Most Excellent Majesty.
We, Your Majesty's most loyal and dutiful Subjects, inhabitants of that portion of the Colony of Western Australia lying to the South of the 24th parallel of latitude and East of the 119th meridian of East longitude, and known as the Eastern Goldfields, humbly approach Your Majesty with every assurance of our loyalty and devotion to Your Majesty's Crown and Person, and humbly entreating Your Majesty's gracious consideration to this our Petition.
1. At the time of the establishment of the present constitution of the Colony of Western Australia, it was contemplated and declared that circumstances might arise and render expedient the division of the Colony by separating any portion thereof and erecting the same into a separate Colony. The probability of such division was expressly reconsidered by Sections 61 and 62 of the Western Australian Constitution Act, 1889 (assented to by Your Majesty on 21st October, 1890), which specially reserved powers on that behalf. We humbly submit that, as regards the Eastern Goldfields, circumstances calling for Separation have now arisen for the following among other reasons: - 
2. Since the establishment of Responsible Government in Western Australia many of Your Majesty's subjects have come from outside the Colony to reside on the Eastern Goldfields. They now compose almost the entire population of that district, which was previously uninhabited and unproductive. By their energy, enterprise, and capital, mines have been discovered and developed, and industries built up and established; and what was previously regarded as a desert has been converted into a populous and prosperous district. The inhabitants of the remaining portion of Western Australia, who are chiefly the settlers before Responsible Government, possess representation in both Houses of Parliament greatly in excess of what they are entitled! to, and have thus acquired a power which they have used, and continue to use, towards the inhabitants of the Eastern Goldfields harshly, arbitrarily, and unjustly, and not in accordance with the spirit of the Constitution. They have passed laws and applied public moneys for their own especial benefit and to our detriment; and have otherwise, by unfair and wrongful legislation and administration, oppressed the inhabitants of the Eastern Goldfields.  In particular: - 
3. (1.) They have denied, and continue to deny to the inhabitants of the Eastern Goldfields, that fair and reasonable representation in Parliament to which such inhabitants are entitled by their number, wealth, and resources, through the power of domination thus secured to and retained by themselves.
(2.) They have imposed unfair and unequal burdens on the inhabitants of the Eastern Goldfields, of which the following are instances: - 
(a) Heavy Customs taxation on food and other commodities, so devised as to place the burden chiefly on us, and to oppress US for the advantage of their monopolies.
(b) Preferential railway rates, imposing special and unequal taxation, intended to establish and support, at our expense, monopolies for their special advantage.
(c) Special taxes on the gold mining industry.
(d) Refusal of railway communication with our natural port on the Southern Coast, in order to force our trade into their portion of the Colony and to distant ports.
(e) The expenditure of a large portion of public moneys in their district, while our larger and more pressing needs are comparatively neglected and ignored.
4. The inhabitants of the Eastern Goldfields are unanimously in favour of joining the Federal Union of the Australian Colonies, and of accepting for that purpose the Bill for the establishment of the Commonwealth of Australia recently adopted by the Parliaments and people of five other Colonies. That Bill was drafted by an Australian Convention in which Western Australia was represented equally with the other Colonies. It was finally settled at a Conference of the Premiers of six Australian Colonies, at which this Colony was represented by its Premier, who accepted the Bill in its final form and promised to endeavour to procure the passing of an Act submitting it to the electors of Western Australia for acceptance or rejection. Instead of this the Bill was referred by the Parliament of Western Australia to a Joint Committee of both Houses, who suggested amendments. A petition signed by 18,000 adult males; resident on the Eastern Goldfields, and 5,000 adult male residents of the Western Districts, was presented to both Houses of Parliament asking that the Bill might be submitted for acceptance or rejection by the people of the Colony, but the Houses of Parliament nevertheless refused by large majorities to grant the prayer of the petition, and the Upper House refused to submit the Bill as adopted by the other Colonies. We are thus prevented, by the arbitrary action of the dominant party in the Parliament of Western Australia, comprised as aforesaid, from realising our intense desire to join the Federal Union and participate in the moral and material advantages of Australian National life. 
When the Western Australian Constitution Act of 1889 was passed the population was 43,000. Queensland obtained responsible Government when its population was 28,000. The population of the Eastern Goldfields, on whose behalf we humbly address Your Majesty, now numbers 80,000, and is rapidly increasing. The district contains by far the greater portion of the wealth, and contributes most of the revenue of the Colony. The area of the Colony, which is 975,920 square miles, or about one-third of Australia, owing to growth of population and diversity of interests, is too large to be properly governed as one Colony. We therefore humbly pray Your Majesty that the Colony of Western Australia may be divided by separating the Eastern Goldfields therefrom according to the boundaries hereinbefore defined, and by erecting the same into a separate Colony, with a full measure of representative and responsible Government, and we, Your Majesty's most loyal and dutiful Subjects, will as in duty bound ever pray.
