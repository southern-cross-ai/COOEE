Bishopscourt, Sydney, 7th November, 1896.
Dear Sir, - 
I regret to say that official engagements, extending over the whole of the week after next, prevent me from having the pleasure of accepting your invitation to be present at the People's Federal Convention at Bathurst.
I trust that the Convention may prove to be (as you hope) of practical and historic importance, and a step zealously and intelligently taken on the path towards those social and political advantages which Federal Government is likely to secure.
Yours faithfully,
WM. S. SYDNEY.
The President,
Bathurst Federation League.
