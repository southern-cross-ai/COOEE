Two other marriages are to take place tomorrow at Parramatta which have causd. a great deal of Interest throughout the whole Colony, You would be a long time in guessing who the Parties are if I did not choose to tell you that they are two Pair of our Sable Countrymen and Women, the latter brought up and civilised by the Native Institutions, the former lately breeched for the occasion. Farm with Farming Utensils &c is given them for the purpose of commencing the Business on a large scale. They have my sincere wishes for their welfare and Prosperity.
