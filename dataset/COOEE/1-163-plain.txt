My dear Madam
I had the great pleasure to receive your letter by the Duke of Wellington with the gloves which you were so kind as to send and the little blocks for the children which created great joy in their little hearts. I wish you could have seen them dancing about the ribbons the night I brought them home. Mrs. M. and myself are thankful to you for your kind remembrances and wish it was in our power to make you any return. Should I visit New Zealand again I will see if I can meet with any minerals &c and send them to your sons. I have sent a few by the bearer and a few seeds for your friends gardens. Miss Hall will I have no doubt deliver them safe. The seeds are quite fresh. I am sorry I have not more for your son but I will not forget him. I have sent a little blue paint from New Zealand in a wafer box whether it is or ever will be of any value I know not. Perhaps your son can inform me when you write again. There are also a few small stones from Cape Barren, but I know not that they are good for anything. I will procure more Iron stone from Fort Dalrymple as soon as I can and send it.  
I am happy to say the Missions go on well in the Islands. These nations have changed their gods and have cast them into the fire - 2000 Natives in the South Sea Islands can now read and have embraced Christianity as their national religion. God hath done great things for them perhaps his power has not been more visibly displayed since the Apostles time than amongst these Natives. At New Zealand also the prospect bids fair. A good School is established there and all the Missionaries are well and kindly treated by the Natives. I will lay out your five pounds for them when the "Active" returns and am much obliged to you for your kind consideration. It will be many years to come before every New Zealander is worth an Ax. They are all wants, they are in a state of Nature and therefore must put a high value upon a needle or a nail. I wish to introduce among them Agriculture. This will immediately apply to their real wants & will be the first thing that will raise them into a civilized nation. I have five now living with me instructing them in Agriculture. I cannot entertain doubt but that the time is now come for these people to be blessed with the Gospel of Peace and that the way is now opened to them. There is great opposition to the work in this Colony but I trust that God in his own good time will remove the enemy and give a little peace. I have been tried more this last year than at any former period of my life but blessed be God I still stand my ground against all the powers that be and hope I shall continue to stand. I often wish to return to the bosom of my Country and frequently resolve to do this but then I am immediately checked with the thought What will the New Zealanders do. What will the Missionaries in all the Islands do if there is none to care for them & administer to their wants and to console them under difficulties. Will England make me happy and relieve my anxiety about the Natives of the South Sea islands. These considerations make me again resolve to meet all difficulties and to contend with them to the last. I have always overcome in time though the contest has sometimes been long and severe. He that hath helped
- me can & will help at all times if we only depend upon his power and goodness. No doubt you will learn somewhat of our late struggles though all has turned out well for the cause of religion in the end.  
I am happy to say Mrs. M. and all my family continue well. My daughters are all much obliged to you for your kindness to them and if you will lay out the Â£5 in bonnets (I mean straw bonnets) which you have instructed me to lay out for you for the Natives of New Zealand I will execute your commands here. I have sent you also by Miss Hall a small New Zealand funnel which will shew you what neat carvers they are and with little or no tools. I beg to refer you to Miss Hall for further accounts. Mrs. M and my daughters desire their kind love to you and your family. The man Massiter whom Mr. Hughes recommended to me put it out of my power to do anything for him. I got him into a good situation or two but he was so addicted to drunkenness and made such a game of everything sacred and religious I was obliged to leave him to himself and I fear he will do something or other that will involve him in difficulties here.
Mr. Vale will have got home before this and perhaps you may have seen him. I do not think he will come out any more here as Mrs. Vale did not like the Country. The rest of my Colleagues are all well.
Remember us kindly to Mr. & Mrs. Hughes and to all your family. We shall always rejoice to hear from you.
I remain
Dear Madam
Yours respectfully
SAMUEL MARSDEN
