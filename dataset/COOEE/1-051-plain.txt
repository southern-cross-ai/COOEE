Biggars (the overseer) whose cruel Treatment of & general ill-Behaviour to the unfortunate men under him they stated to be universally known to all Descriptions of people in the Colony - that said Biggars is in the constant Habit of knocking the men down without Cause or provocation and otherwise abusing and ill-treating them - that their allowance of Food is so extremely scanty as to be insufficient to support them in Labor, yet the said Biggars allots them more work than twice the number of men could perform in the time - that altho' they had 50 Rods to reap, each man daily, they contrived with great Labor & application from the dawn of Day until night to accomplish their Task work with a view to have friday to themselves and when Friday came & their week's Task Work was finished they thought themselves at liberty to leave the Farm for their own Earnings - wholly deny any Disobedience of orders.
