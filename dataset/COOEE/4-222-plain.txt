I question if he has written home yet. We could have given him work here and had written to him telling him so if he could get her into some place in Melbourne or if she had any friends with whom to stop with for a while. He could have done better to have left her at home and sent money home to keep her. I had word through a letter from Mr. Newson's that they were looking for a situation as a married couple and is stopping in Mr. Hanna's. I suppose it is with the old man out at Mitcham. I think you were wrong to send them to John as he has no accommodation for a married couple. He would have to put up a partition wall and board the floor. He could have done with David single handed as we could given him fencing and ring barking of timber and besides it is 30 miles off a doctor where John is which might make things rather awkward in case David's wife would need one. Hugh also wrote to James to try and meet them but he says he could not leave the business as he had nobody but a little fellow of 14 to look after the shop so you see it would feel very awkward for them and John has no money to spend on training 180 miles while I am 178 miles and Hugh about the same, James 90 miles. James wrote to the ship at Adelaide giving him instructions how to act and also sent one to John Hanna asking him to assist David with his boxes etc. I do wish he may be successful in getting a place. I should have liked very much to have seen him. Perhaps I will at a more convenient season. Who paid for the wife's passage and how much money had they. Let us know who seen them off by the boat and if any of her friends were there
