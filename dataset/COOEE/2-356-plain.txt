The depot into which they are received, when discharged from their services, is a scene of feasting, complete idleness and vicious indulgence. The women are occasionally let into the town, and have free communication with their associates. When they bring forth illegitimate children they are received into a nursery, where they live on the same abundant fare, and with nothing to do but nurse their infants; as soon as the children are of proper age, they are sent to the Orphan School which should be called the school for illegitimate children of the convicts, and the mothers are dismissed to repeat the same expensive course of conduct. 
It is perfectly notorious and indubitable, that the common practise of the convict women is to get into service, in order to obtain money by theft or prostitution, and return to the depot to spend it with their associates. The natural consequence is, that they are utterly insubordinate and lead most flagitious lives, refusing to stop in any place where a restraint is put on their vices, plainly telling their masters that they infinitely prefer the dep√¥t - the scene of jollity and every evil communication.
