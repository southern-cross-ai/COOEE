My dear Edward, 
I soppose you will be disapointed not hering from me last Mail but Susan will explain. I hope you will like the enclosed. I tell you dear Edward what I want you to do. That is to get me a good Cart  of your dear Mama. I did not like the cased one for it looked so old and I did not think Good. 
We ar getting on as usual. I was delighted with that pleasing newse of last Mail. I shall be glad to hear of the dear Girl having a happy home of her own. I should so like to know if you ar thining of taking that desperat step. I hope you will some day when you can meet with one worthy of you, that will make you a good Wife. Do let me into the secret. 
I must tell you a little Newse. Uncle Robert Wylys Alaxander is Married and living in the Bush. He is keeping a General Store. We have not seen her yet and I do not think we shall for some time to come. His Brother Tom is living with them. Uncle Alaxander is getting  as usual. Henrietta is keeping a School. I told you Fanny was married. William does not think of any just yet. He is quite the Gentleman, that family has done very well. They have kept up their posicion. Alaxander is in a goverment Situation. 
Poor Ruth she has had her triales. She has 5 little ones the eldest 10 years old and no Servants doing the best she can for them. Mr Shadgit faild this last year, so the were left pennyless. I give you this newse for your Mama. I am sure she will like to know how all ar doing. Every thing has  so dull this last year those that ar left to get on can just keep their heads above water. 
Do you think you could get me a few more Vewse of Ireland or I shoul like Dublin as I know more about it. I think Uncle John could. Would you please ask him. You can get them much cheaper. I shall pay for them if you let me know what the will be. 
I must bring this hasty scrible to a close hoping the next will be longer but I coul not say more, or it would make this to heavy. I think I sent you our likenesses. Let me know. I should like to see yours. I have not seen that yong friend of yours yet. Is he gone to Melbourne. Good by dear Edward with Dear love to Mama and also your good self. In writing give Uncle yours. 
I remain your fond & Affectionate Aunt I. A. Scott Ps 
Pleas hast write soon. I hope you got the Austrilian Paprs. We shall send them evry Mail.
