It is argued that any diminution of the hours of labor will have the effect of increasing the cost of production, and thereby have a tendency to arrest the investment of capital in some of the various ways in which it is now being laid out. We doubt, indeed, whether as much work is not frequently done in eight hours as in ten. Compare the style of work of a fresh with that of an exhausted man! Would any one presume to say that the labor of the one is not preferable to that of the other in the proportion often to eight? Is it not a saying as old as the hills that one hour in the morning is worth two at night? And why so? Simply because in the morning a man is fresh, and works with a will, and with all his faculties about him; in the evening he is too often jaded, and languid, and finds that every stroke he has to strike is a real effort and a bore  We think eight hours in a climate like this is sufficient for any ordinary man and we conceive it to be quite possible for a man to turn out as good a day's work in that time as he would in a much longer one.
But, passing by the question of the possibility of increased cost of production by reduced hours of labor, the lowered rate of interest, the consequent diversion of capital, scarcity of employment, and lowered wages, let us take a glance at the case of the individual workman. He is told by his "supply and demand" friends that if he reduces his hours of work he inevitably, sooner or later, reduces his rate of remuneration. Let us take this for granted, and still see if he be not a better and happier man? The proposition is to divide the four-and-twenty hours into equal parts - eight hours for work, eight for repose, and eight for food and recreation. But what is this "recreation" which is so much sought for? Not skittles at the Black Bull, we will be bound; not dancing at Cremorne, fishing on the banks of the Yarra, or lounging in the promenade concerts of the enterprising Jacobs ! The working man may consistently enough indulge in such modes of relaxation now and then; but it would little jump either with his tastes or his interest to consider this the sort of recreation to which he should accustom himself. No; to the really industrious and active-minded artizan the truth is well known that "a change of work is half a holiday", and it is to the peaceful pleasures of home that he looks with a longing eye as he struggles for relief from the exactions of a severe system. And how will the money account stand of a man like this? He earns, we will say, three pounds a week, and finds that the "supply and demand" gentleman mulct him of a fifth part of his wages in consequence of releasing him from a fifth part of his labor - or rather hours of labor.  Is he a poorer man by the deduction of these twelve shillings a week? By no means. He fills up his spare time by digging in his garden, feeding his poultry, milking his cow, teaching his children; and he finds that his daily two hours thus employed save him far more than twelve shillings a week by decreased bills at the butcher's, baker's, grocer's - not to say the public-house and the doctor's. The quantity and variety of food which an industrious man can place upon his table by the intelligent bestowal of an hour or two a day will astonish even himself; and lie will find that there s little comparison to be made in the pleasantness of such pursuits, with his children round him, and the ceaseless toiling and moiling during long hours in a dusty Street in Melbourne.
We have no means of knowing how far the present movement is likely to be successful. The great obstacle exists in the very frequent adoption of piecework; in the impossibility of getting all men to think alike; and in the certainty that however sturdily A., B., and C. may stick to the Eight Hour's system, D., E., and F. will find some reason for declining it. Successful or not, however, we must say that we have observed with considerable pleasure the tone of moderation and the indications of very considerable intelligence by which the meetings have been characterised whose proceedings have been reported in the newspapers. At the same time rather delicate ground has been entered upon; and under such circumstances the interests of the whole body of working-men are only too liable to be compromised by the injudicious acts of a mere fraction of their number. We understand that alarm has already been taken by the course adopted by some of the workmen employed at the new Legislative Council Chambers; contractors are withdrawing their tenders upon all sides, and the Government is hesitating upon entering into any new work. It behoves the intelligent artizan always to remember that, while he has a perfect right to say how many hours of the twenty-four he will devote to labor, capital is a sensitive thing, - that capital upon the employment of which he necessarily subsists; and that if the sources from which it flows become once congealed by distrust, it is not a very easy matter to set them flowing again.
