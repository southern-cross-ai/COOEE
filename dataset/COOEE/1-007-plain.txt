Most of the officers have cultivated a little ground, but is merely for their own conveniency, and none more than a single acre, except the Lieutenant-Governor, who has about three acres. I have sixteen at a small farm on the public account.
It must, my Lord, be settlers, with the assistance of the convicts, that will put this country in a situation for supporting its inhabitants; nothing but the uncertainty of the time in which my letters may reach England, and the possibility of those last written being the first received, would make me trouble your Lordship in this letter with a repetition of what I have fully explained in my former letters - that the people who are not convicts are necessary for the stores, from which provisions or stores are delivering almost hourly, and that we want for superintending the convicts such as have been brought up in the line in which they are now employed.
