Daily, as the various and widespread sections of the human family are being insensibly drawn into closer touch with each other, it becomes clearer that men should become co-operators - mates - instead of antagonists. "No man liveth to himself." We are all mutually dependent one upon another. Under the existing order of things, however, each is forced into warfare with his fellow, and life is made a struggle in which the success of the winner means that those whom unjust conditions have forced into a fight are crushed back into hopeless misery. So long as man depends upon his fellow man for leave to toil, so long will the lives of the great mass be one continuous struggle, rendered more keen and uncertain by every scientific and mechanical appliance brought in to facilitate wealth-production. Nature's storehouse - holds ample supplies to gratify the needs of all; but so long as the few are allowed to hold possession the many must starve. The doors of the storehouse must be thrown open to all, and the toll-bar of monopoly broken down ere justice can be done. Production must be for use and not for profit before robbery of labor will cease, and the fear of poverty be for ever banished. With the disappearance of enforced poverty, crime will gradually cease. With machinery put to its proper use that of contributing to the happiness of mankind - the increased leisure will give opportunities for the cultivation of all those higher faculties latent in man, but now repressed by the pressure of a social system which makes the satisfaction of mere material wants an all-absorbing struggle.
It is evident that the changes so essential to the true progress and development of all that is best in humanity can only be effected by setting up its accomplishment as our aim, and working towards its realization. Experience has taught us that no great reform can be secured otherwise than by systematic organized effort. Alone we can agitate. Organized we can compel. It is by the organization of Unions that the conditions of life for all have been prevented from becoming worse than they are. To continue, however, upon the lines of old Trades Unionism alone will but stave off the crash that now stares our civilization in the face. To narrow the fight to a mere question of employers and workmen is but a waste of energy, and can never secure that social reconstruction which will leave one no longer dependent upon another, but under which all shall have equal opportunities. 
Realizing then that we must attack a system, and change it so that there will no longer be room for conflict between interests-no room for narrow selfishness to govern men's actions, the Australian Workers' Union Starts with new aims. Realizing that all workers, no matter what their occupation or sex may be, have a common interest, the A.W.U. aims at embracing all in its ranks. Whilst it of necessity uses that power which combination and that alone gives for protection of present material interest, the A.W.U. looks to education and such social and political reform as strike at the root of the injustice from which the masses now suffer. By loyalty to principle, unity of purpose, aim, and method, alone can we succeed. Rules are but a means to secure unity of action, nevertheless their observance and recognition is essential to success. We trust, therefore, that each member of the A.W.U. will strive to understand the high and noble aim this Union has in view, and become an active unit in the great army of reform. Active as an agitator and true to his comrades, as a Unionist always is, and success is certain.
