 it was all I could do to drag myself along. I was stiff and sore in every joint. At last I reached the hut and found the hutkeeper and he immediately set about getting something to eat. I was now 72 hours without having anything at all to eat. I thought a good wash all over would revive me so I went down to the river and it looked so tempting I undressed and jumped into a deep hole. I was scarcely in until I was paralysed all over and could not move my legs or hands at all. I came to the top, then went down again, then up and I saw a branch of a tree hanging over my head and with a great effort I managed to move my hand up and catch it and I slowly drew myself to shore. After some difficulty I got out and then I began to come to and was soon alright and went up to have a good tuck in but at the first mouthful I was sick and could scarcely eat anything. A few hours after, I managed to eat a good substantial meal.
