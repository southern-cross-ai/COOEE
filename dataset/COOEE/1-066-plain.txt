My dear Madam
It is with pleasure I take up my pen to acknowledge the receipt of your two last letters and the parcell received by the Atlas for which I return you my sincere thanks. The things were exceedingly useful but consider them as the strongest proof I am not forgot by so good a woman.
I rejoice that Mr. and Mrs. Johnson reached England in safety and had an happy meeting with their friends. Am glad to find from Mrs. Kent that Mr. Johnson has recovered his health so well and trust that before this they are settled comfortable and to their own wishes.  I daily regret the loss of Mrs. Johnson's society from this country so much so that I have not visited Sydney but once since she left it and that was to wean my little girl Elizabeth. Our society of married ladies increase, there are now twenty. There never were so many at a time since the Colony was established. I wished I could say we increased in divine things, but we still continue in the same depraved state as ever. You who have so many privileges can have no idea of our situation.
You have no doubt heard what an affliction we have been visited with in the melancholy death of our dear little boy. We was going to the farm a servant was driving him and me in a single horse chaise. Mr. Marsden was on horseback when a man twenty yards from our own home carelessly run a wheelbarrow directly under the wheel of the chaise and overturned it, and my dear child never stirred more. I received no hurt myself though I was but two months of my time. I am conscious that his was a happy translation yet dear Madam picture to yourself my feelings to have him in health and spirits and the next moment to behold him in the arms of Death. I was wonderfully supported and had one consolation which the world cannot give neither take away. He who is faithful has promised when thou passest through the waters I will be with thee and through the rivers they shall not overflow thee. God is a refuge & strength, a very present help in time of need. This is the first time I have taken up my pen to write to England since I lost him though it is now fifteen months. I am afraid I am very sinful. I often think could I know his little thoughts he would reprove me for wishing him back in this troublesome world, but his removal has stirred me up to he more earnest in Divine things, and though he cannot come to me I may meet him in that place, where sin & sorrow and sighing are fore ever done away. I have still one little girl & boy with me the youngest John is a little turned of a twelve month old. This letter will be delivered by Mrs. ,Johnson the Surgeons wife that left England a little after us who I believe you saw. I was very much disappointed in your letter that on did not mention in what part of the world Mr. Edward was, if he is with you beg my kind respects to him.  Mrs. Hughes arrived safe here, they reside in Sydney. The Governor gave him a superintendents place soon after their arrival so that I seldom see her. Mr. Marsden joins me with best respects to Mr. Stokes & family. Let me intreat to be remembered in your prayers and believe me
Yours with respect
E. MARSDEN
