He was a man, prompt in deed as in thought, and forthwith purchasing a sheep at a butcher's stall in Sydney, had it slaughtered and boiled down, when it yielded 24 lbs. of tallow. The experiment was repeated, and eventuated in a grand success; such a discovery was not long making itself known - a Mr Henry O'Brien of Yass, and others, further tested it; and the boiling down of not only sheep, but cattle, soon spread.
Port Phillip was not slow in profiting by what might be termed an invention, the importance of which could not possibly be over-rated. Boiling-down establishments, as they were called, were opened in several places, the first at the Salt Water River, by Bolden and Ryrie, two squatters, who placed it under the control of a Mr R. Forrest, possessed of much practical knowledge acquired in Cork, the then pig-killing entrep√¥t for the exportation of pork carcase-meat from the South of Ireland to England. Mr Edward Curr opened another at Port Fairy, and Dr Thompson, at Geelong. Hunter Somerville and Co. built premises for the purpose in Bourke Street; Brock and Mollison, and Watson and Wight had large establishments at the Melbourne swamp (now the Spencer Street Railway Station). Boiling down was soon improved into melting down (the complete antithesis of the meat freezing projects of to-day) and the profitable outlet thus presented for realising on stock wrought such a change, that prices immediately improved and manifestations of amendment showed themselves.
