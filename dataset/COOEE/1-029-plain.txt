How far that part of your letter to which the above alludes may have been intended to convey to me his Majesty's permission to return, I am doubtful, and although I am inclined to think it has been written with that intention, and feel how necessary it is for me to give up, at least for a time, the charge of this Government, which is very far from what I wish to do at the moment, the colony is approaching to that state in which I have so long and anxiously wished to see it; still, sir, I fear there is a possibility of its being expected that I should remain until permission to quit the Government is more fully and clearly expressed; and as there appears to be a wish that I should remain in this country some time longer, I shall await the arrival of the next ships.
