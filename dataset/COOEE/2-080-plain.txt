He has indeed, by the regulations of the government, sufficient food and clothing, but the dread of his master's frown is to him what the drawn sword was, over the head of Dionysius's courtier! 
The spirit of the convict however is not subdued by unmingled Severity. Encouragement forms part of the plan by which he is reclaimed; and the circumstances under which he is placed, are very favourable to his reformation as well as to his punishment. His mind is not dissipated by the example and advice of idle and wicked persons, not under a similar restraint with himself. There is presented to him the choice of two opposite paths. The one after patient endurance of fatigue, and a resolute continuance in its course, will lead him to the possession of a ticket of leave. The other on the contrary will conduct him by a short cut, to the government gang or the penal settlement where he will be subjected to every privation compatible with the maintenance of his health.
Thus it is that every man has afforded him an opportunity of in a great measure retrieving his character and becoming useful in society, while the resolutely and irrecoverably depraved are doomed to live apart from it for the remainder of their lives.
