Dear Sir,
I have much pleasure in availing myself of the first opportunity that offers since the receipt of your letters to Mrs. McArthur and Mrs. Marsden to return my acknowledgments for your kind remembrances - and to assure you Capt. Kent and myself were much disappointed on returning to Port Jackson to find you had left it. - The Buffalo is under sailing orders for Dalrymple and I believe there is a probability of her extending her voyage to Norfolk Island - permit me to say your being a resident there is a great inducement to my visiting the Island exclusive of the temptation you hold out viz. "dancing down the Government House & Lansdown Place." but really these long voyages have had such a serious effect upon my health that for some time to come (however unwilling) I must relinguish them - Our passage from Calcutta was rendered extremely pleasant by the society of two Gentlemen whom I have the pleasure of introducing to your acquaintance, Mr. Serer and Mr. Sanders - as their stay at Norfolk will be very short if you could assist them in procuring some Tropic Feathers I should consider myself obliged - if there is anything Cap Kent or myself can do for you here, we beg you will command us, in the meantime accept our best wishes and believe me Dear Sir
Yours very sincerely, Eliza Kent
PS: By the last vessel from Norfolk I had a letter from Daveron requesting I would make interception for him - being a stranger to the nature of his offences I can only state such a request was made - I saw several persons in India who were much interested in his welfare, and his connections in that part of the World are very respectable - I therefore hope on their account as well as his own whatever misdemeanours he may have been guilty of they will not prevent him regaining his liberty should a fair opportunity offer.
