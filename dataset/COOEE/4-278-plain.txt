A fortnight ago he wrote the inspector Bunbury and he wrote to me. I went in and passed a rough exam and a stiff medical one. I had to pay the medical myself 10s.6d. for the certificate. The Inspector said I would probably have to go to Perth and get sworn in almost immediately but I have not got orders yet. The pay is about £7 per month but you have to grub yourself (£1 a week out here). I wish I was on the force. I am about sick of here  
I am sure to be sent North where the niggers are committing great depredations. They chained up a copper the other day and sacked the station.
