On another occasion I was thrown from my horse about two miles from home and dislocated an elbow and both wrists and sprained an ankle. In this state I crawled home, where I lay for three days before the doctor could reach me, but the dislocations were reduced in a few minutes when he did come; but all cases were not of so urgent or painful a character as these.
