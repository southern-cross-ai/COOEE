Besides the bunks are very much more comfortable and the food is a great deal better (which is a very important item to a delicate person who has not a good appetite and cannot eat anything that may be given to them.) Let me here say that I would by no means advise coming by third class. I want to impress upon you the importance of this. 
It is not necessary for you to bring a lot of clothes as you might not find them quite suitable to the climate but be sure to have something warm to wear in the cold parts of the voyage also some light to wear in the hot parts as you will find a great change of climate in the whole course of the voyage. 
Decide at once about whether you are coming or not and when you have decided, take your passage in the earliest possible steamer. The best steamers are the Orizaba, Ormuz, Oroya, Austral, Orient, Liguria. These are the biggest, newest and swiftest steamers but any of them are swift and I think the second class accommodation on any of them would be pretty fair. 
If you start soon you shall be in time to see our great exhibition. It is a very grand affair I believe.  The building covers about 35 1/2 acres. I would like to see it very much but shall put that off until you come when I can kill two birds with the one stone that is go down to Melbourne to meet you and see the exhibition. James will forward some money shortly which will help to pay for your expenses of travelling.
