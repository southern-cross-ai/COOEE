Brisbane, Nov. 30th, 1896.
Sir - 
I have the honour to acknowledge your letter of 22nd October, forwarding a confidential memorandum with respect to the Bathurst Federation movement, which, in consequence of my absence in New Guinea, I have only just received. I have noticed with great pleasure the success of the late Convention, which, so far as I have been able to form an opinion, is likely to prove a valuable aid to the cause of Australian Federation.
May I be allowed to offer my congratulations to the Bathurst League upon the success that has attended their efforts.
I am, Sir, your obedient Servant,
S. W. GRIFFITH.
W. Astley, Esq., Corresponding Secretary.  
Mr. Chief Justice Way, of South Australia, also wrote regretting exceedingly his inability to be present at the Convention, which he looked upon as a gathering of national importance. It could not fail to attract public attention throughout Australia to the Federal question, and to throw light upon the aspects of it which require to be dealt with.
