given to the Irish Rebels implicated in the recent Seditious Assemblies and Consultations which have been held in different parts of the Colony of New South Wales to the great danger of His Majesty's Government and the public peace; as narrated by, - 
JOSEPH HOLT, FORMER GENERAL OF THE IRISH REBELS, IN 1798,
who was arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the present affair, but was acquitted by the direct orders of His Excellency Governor King, as herein narrated.
In a few days after my arrest, there was nineteen men brought from Sidney jail before the governor to be examined and eighteen of them turned informers and everyone asked about me and not one man had the least thing against me. So we had a bad Clutch of Troblesome Raskils and what else cud we Expect. There was floging Everyday till some of them never got better of it till they died at last, and some of them was so good as to bring Dr Harrel, the priest, in by their Information. He was in jail.
The six day of October 1800 we got orders to go in the boat - Mr Smith came to me and Brought me out of the prison and he and a few men went in the government Boat and when I was about ten miles from Sidney I saw the passage boat comming down and Mrs Holt and her young Child. I tould Mr Smith that I saw her and he ordered the boat to Row toward the passage boat to take Mrs Holt for to return back and came to parmatta. There all the prisoners were put into jail except the priest. He was left in a house with a gard with him. Mr Smith let me go with Mrs Holt on honour to call on him in the morning.
I did attend to the minute and we march'd up to towngabby where all the Government men was, and this was the plan to give them the opportunity of seeing the punishment inflicted on several. There was one man of the Name of Morris Fitzegarrel and he was ordered to Recaive three Hundred lashes.
The way they floged them was theire armes pulled Round a large tree and their breasts squezed against the tree so the men had no power to cringe or stir. Father Harrel was ordered to lay his hand against the tree by the hand of the man that was floging. There was two flogers, Richard Rice and John Jonson, the Hangman from Sidney. Rice was a left handed man and Jonson was Right handed so they stood at each side and I never saw two trashers in a barn moove there stroakes more handeyer then those two man killers did.
The moment they begun I turn my face Round towards the other side and one of the Constibles came and Desired me to turn and look on. I put my hand in my pocket and pulled out my pen knife and swore I Rip him from the navil to the Chin. They all gather Round me and woud have ill used me but Mr Smith came over and ask'd them who gave them any orders about me so they wore oblige to walk off. I cud compare them to a pack of hounds at the death of hair, all yelping. I turned once about and as it happened I was to leew'rd of the flogers and I protest, tho' I was two perches from them, the flesh and skin blew in my face as they shooke off the cats.
Fitzegarrel Recaiv'd his 300 lashes. Doctor Mason (I never will forget him) use to go to feel his pulls and he smiled and sayd "this man will tire you before he will fail, - go on".  It is against the law to flog a man past 50 lashes without a Doctor, and during the time he was geting his punishment he never gave as much as a word; only one and that was saying, "Dont strike me on the Nick, flog me fair." When he was let loose two of the Constibles went and tuck hould of him by the arms to help him in the Cart. I was standing by he said to them, "let my arms go," struck both of them with his elbows in the pit of the somack and nock them boath down and then step in the Cart. I herd Doctor Mason say "that man had strength in nuff to bear two hundredd more."
Next was tyed up was paddy galvin, a young boy about twenty years of age. He was ordered to get three hundred lashes. He got one hundred on the back and you cud see his back bone between his shoulder blades, then the Doctor order him to get another hunder on his bottom. He got it and then his huckles was in such a Jelly the Doctor order him to be flog on the Calves of his legs. He got one hunder there and as much as a whimper he never gave. They asked him if he would tell where the pikes was hid, he said he did not now, and if he did he would Not tell. "You may as well hang me Now," he says, "for you never will get any musick from me." So they put him in the Cart and sent him to the Hospital.
There was two more got one hunder each and they sung out from first to last. One of them was named Mick Fitzegarrild, a shoemaker. Then three more was County Cork men live Near sir Henry Brown Hayes.
When the floging was over Mr Smith and I walked on to parmatta and went into the Hotell kept by James Larra, a honest Jew. The table was soon furnished with a nice lampy and some hung beef - we took Dinner.
I was joined with the Company of my wife and Child and went in the boat. The land breese was in our favour and the tide also; the tide Runs up sixteen miles. We went down in one hour and forty minutes and then I was Braught up to Connal William Patterson, Lieutenant governor and several others, to Recaive the dreadful sentence pass on us. Several was ordered into Jail till they would be sent to Norfoulk Island.
The Connal turns to me and sayes, "Mr Holt, it is Governor King's orders that you must take charge of the Jail gauge and overseer them." I was standing by my wife, look'd at him about one minute and said, "with summisin to you, sir, I hope you will Deliver my answer to his Excellency. I have been Exempted by Governor Hunter and I have not Committed any fault since in this Colony, and if Governor King has law and power to make me overseer of the Jail gange, he has in his power to take my life. I will Comply with the latter before I will yild to the first."
The good ould Gentleman went Directly and tould the Governor what I sayed. My wife sayed, "my dear, you have a mind to loose your life by your unfortunate temper." I said, "I did not care how soone, for Dam the world, I sooner be Dead that to be striveing to live." By this time the Connal came back and sade the Governor wanted me. "I will go, sir, to Recaive Death or worse punishment." I was conducted by the only sorgant in the room.
The Governor luck'd very earnest at me to see what sort of countenance I had and after some time he says "you are a very fond man of your family?"
"Yes, your Excellency, as a father and husband aught to be, and trust, sir, you like me the better."
"Go home, sir, with your wife and Come to me and I will give you a Grant of Ground for them." I Bow'd and walking toward my wife I says, "my dear, you and I will be late home." The poor hart-broken Creature Cud hardly seport herself from been overjoyed; for too much Joy over ballanced as much in some measure, as too much grief.
I went in and thanked Connal Patterson for all favours, and went down to Henry Cables and got some wine and Rum, and went in the boat, and it was one o'clock in the morning before I Ratched Mr Coxe's house. I made the boats man put me and my wife a shore, and when they heard my voice, the Mistress and her Childer were up in a few minutes and shew'd every proof of affectin and love to me and wife. So after a short conversation I went home to Brush farm.
