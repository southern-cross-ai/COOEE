She is now eighteen months old; such a very fine child and beginning to be very interesting. Her name is Christiana Eliza Passmore, after my mother's maiden name. What will you say when I tell you perhaps ere you receive this letter you may have another little cousin. If a girl she shall be named Louisa Matilda; if a boy, Barrington. I think your Aunt Matilda will say we stock our house too fast now, but in this colony we are only considered very moderate folks.  Most people add one to their family every year, and as there are so few disorders fatal to children in this colony there will in a few years be larger grown-up families in this part of the world than any other...
Our three boys are all well and growing up fast, but they are as wild as young kangaroos and as mischievous as monkeys, but not unlike other children at their age. Thomas is still small of his age, but very sensible, manly, and quick at his lessons; very passionate but very affectionate, so that I do not despair of making him anything I please. Richard is a stout fellow, in my opinion a fine handsome boy, an excellent temper, but more mischievous than any of them. Johnny is a little innocent child, very fond of being made a pet of, rather odd looking, with very light blue eyes and light curly hair. He is quick like Thomas. It is a sad thing not having a school to send them to. I regret it more on account of keeping them away from our farm servants than from what they would learn. I take them myself to school for two hours every day, and Thomas is beginning to read very nicely. He can say the church and their other catechisms, besides several of Watt's hymns very nicely. Richard is rather dull, but I dare say he will improve by and by. I hope in another year to be able to send Thomas to the clergyman of our district to school, as he proposes taking a few pupils above eight years old. We will endeavour to bring Thomas forward as fast as we can and persuade Mr Wilkinson to take him before he is eight years old. He is a very nice man, and we should know he was taken care of in every sense and improved in moral as well as learning.
