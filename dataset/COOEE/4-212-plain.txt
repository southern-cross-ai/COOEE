As to Mr. and Mrs. Beazley they have not quite decided yet what line they will go into, but I fear not that in a very short time I shall be able to locate them safely in some handy place either to manage a small club or boarding house. There are some fine places of that kind here  
I have been making considerable headway and have had the doings of some first class ballrooms etc. and all my efforts have met with success and been very much admired by the guests and spoken highly of by the Press, so that is good and I am glad to find that my experience gained in the old country serves me well here and will doubtless stand to me a.1. 
I have joined hands with a Portrush chap a Mr. Richardson, better known as the chap who used to win a lot of races at the swimming races at Pickie Rock at Bangor, so is it not really wonderful how people tumble together nowadays. Truly the world is small. He is a very handy sort of fellow and as he was looking out for something of the line we are in, we tumbled together and took a place which so far suits us well and are kept very busy and your new nurios  that I have introduced for ballroom decoration and sale take well, so that we never know what results may come yet.
