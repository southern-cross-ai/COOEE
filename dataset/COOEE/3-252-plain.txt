My dear Miss Lewin,
I am very glad I came to Australia, but I cannot say I like it very much. It is such an out of the world place and so monotonous, but as far as kind treatment goes I could not meet with nor desire kinder - with no one in this neighbourhood have I seen the social distinctions made with Governesses that there is at home - I have very little work here in comparison with London - I do not think £80 per annum here as much as £60 at home, dress is very expensive and the people are dressy - You will be glad to hear that my pupil has made great progress in all her studies but particularly in music, which pleases Mrs Hines very much. They brought out a very nice piano. 
In fact 'Bush life' is a strange mixture of roughing and refinement. In this district are two distinct sets, one gentry, and one would-be gentry - there are more of the latter. In the former I think an unfinished unladylike Governess would be unwelcome. Literature is much more brought forward here, in the general way, than at home because there are no new daily topics - the standing one is sheep - in which ladies take no part - of course.
Accept my kind regards
and believe me truly yours
Louisa Agnes Geoghegan
