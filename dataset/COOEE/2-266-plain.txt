The wages of these, including reapers and shearers, come to about £2000 a year, independent of their rations, which averages about two and a half tons of sugar, eight chests of tea, eight tons of flour and five hundred sheep per annum, of a value of about £800. My gross receipts for this year are about £6500 and the working expenses about £3000. My last balance showed the value of all the property I now possess to be about £20,000. I find from a careful examination of accounts since I first arrived in the colony that I have doubled my capital every two and a half years.
