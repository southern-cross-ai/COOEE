My Dear Sir
It is the request of a very Dear Mother, and sincere wish of my affectionate Sisters that I should address you but beg firstly to introduce myself as George, the youngest Son of your Cousin Mrs M Reibey and as such put forth a claim (Tho but slight) to your friendship - but do not suppose this arises merely from a submission to the will of a Parent, or an acquiescence to the wishes of my Sisters, No Sir - receive it as a tribute of gratitude offered by the loving Son of Her to whom you showed so much kindness and attention - Nothing be assured calls forth sooner as kindness shown to Her, the unfeigned sentiments of esteem or grateful feeling from the breast of any of the offspring of a Mother - whose long anxious and great exertion for the improvement and future happiness was scarcely ever surpassed.  
In speaking of those we love, an enthusiasm often times carries us far beyond what the cool observing eye thinks due; but these believe me are the genuine sentiments of a Heart impressed with a deep sence of gratitude to Him whose great mercy and kindness bestowed so sure a blessing in the Land of Depravity.
Once again permit me to return not only my sincere thanks but those of all my Brothers and Sisters to you, your dr. Brother and Sister, and all your kind hearted friends for the very great kindness and unremitting attention bestowed upon Person so Dear to us all.
It is the intention of my Brothers Thos. & James to write to you all, it is out of their power to take advantage of this conveyance, both being residents of Van Diemens Land, one of Launceston the other of Hobart Town on opposite sides of the Island, there not being any regular Mail from either of these places they forward all letters for Europe through me which probably they may do before this Vessel sails.
A letter from my Sister Celia Date 26th Octob. at Glasgow when on a Visit to you came to hand on the 26th Inst. She says it was our Mother's purpose to leave England in about three Months from that Date - now therefore we are anxiously and hourly expecting Her.
I forwarded a Paquet about 5 mos. since enclosed in one from a Mr Hollstonecraft a resident here to a Mr Berry a passenger by the Cockburn, but being simply Directed "Mrs Reibey". I am apprehensive it did not reach Her as it is most probable He did not know what part of England She was in or how to dispose of it. if so In the event of such being the case, I beg you will have the goodness to learn what became of it, A letter left at Loyds will find the Gentleman.
I would have given you a description of our Country, its manner customs &c (which I presume might have been somewhat interesting) had not my Mother & Sisters got the start of me. one or two circumstances only worth mentioning have transpired since their departure among which the one of greatest importance is Distillation permission for which has been recently granted by the British Governt to the Colonies.  
A new Colony has lately been Planted at a place named Port McQuarie about two hours. to the Northwards of Port Jackson Head Quarter, its foundation has for its object the cultivation of the sugar cane being much warmer than here / the highest hopes are entertained of its success / if such are realised, very great advantages by its means will accrue to the Country - an important Article for Exportation will be afforded which is much wanted, it will also detain in circulation a great portion the Colonial Capital which is annually sent out for foreign produce,
Mr Commissioner Biggs sailed for England about three Mos. Past finished his Enquiry from the result of which Great Changes are expected, Public opinion differ widely as to their consequent tendency whether to the advantage or disadvantage of the Country,- one party draw their conclusion from his having from the time of his arrival attached himself to a certain Party existing here whose sole object is their own aggrandisement with the depression of those who have once been Prisoners, without any reason to their real Interests of the Colonies.
But cool reflection will show such can never happen, that class of People not only the most numerous but the most opulent,- neverless if an attempt of such a nature should be made it is not impossible that a second Washington might rise up among us but by the bye as we are not yet independent perhaps such an expectation may be considered too much of Treason which we read of here is often punished with either an Axe or an Halter and speaking sincerely I should not much relish the performance of such an operation on my own Neck, / But the English themselves I find by your News Papers take great liberties with their Rulers without molestation. and likely an unconscious or ignorant expression of an Australian Savage might be looked over for once /  
I have frequently when here heard my Mother speak of Relations named Hargreaves but forbears mentioning them in any of Her Letters since her arrival in England.
I am quite at loss what to attribute it to, whether to forgetfulness on her part or unkindness on theirs I hope there's no exception.
I shall feel great Interest in forming a correspondence with both you & Mr Jn. & Willm. Hope should have written to them by this Vessel but I believe she does not touch any part of England
If the Edinbourg Review could be sent out with convenience to yourself I should consider it as a great favouor if you could transmit it regularly. 
Conclude with being My Dear Sir, with great esteem
Yours Geo. Reibey.
