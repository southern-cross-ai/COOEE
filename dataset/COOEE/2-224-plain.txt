That the plan & principle upon which the Sydney Auction is conducted & which have been found to work so admirably be adopted as the System of conducting the affairs of this Company.
While the projectors of this Company admit that the profitable results of such an institution must mainly depend upon its judicious management they at the same time feel confident that the period has arrived for the formation of such a Company and that no public Institution as yet formed in Melbourne offers so many advantages to the Proprietors with so little risk and so small an outlay of Capital....
Fifty Shares to qualify for Directorship.
