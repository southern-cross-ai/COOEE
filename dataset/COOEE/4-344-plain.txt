Sir, 
I have the honour to acknowledge your letter of the 23rd inst., enclosing an address to myself from the People's Federal Convention at Bathurst. I have further to request you to convey my thanks to Dr. Machattie, the President, as the official representative of the Convention, for the above mentioned Address, and for the expressions of loyalty to the person and throne of Her Majesty contained in it. I hope and believe that the work that has been done by the Convention will help to throw light on some of the difficult problems that must be solved before the Federation of the Australian colonies can be brought to a successful issue.
I have the honour to be, Sir,
Your most obedient Servant,
HAMPDEN.
(The Rev. Arthur J. Webb, Secretary to the People's Federal Convention, Bathurst.)
