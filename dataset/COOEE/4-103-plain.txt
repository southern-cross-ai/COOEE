Though few, the decorations, mostly in flowers and ferns, were extremely chaste, and looked exceedingly pretty, but the pupils themselves all arrayed in white with rich cardinal satin sashes presented an appearance 'more exquisite still'. The pupils, 200 or more, a considerable per centage boarders, were ranged on ascending rows at one side of the hall . . - The assemblage was a brilliant one in every respect, the fair ladies in their elegant dresses, lending that charming element of grace and beauty inseparable from a fashionable school celebration ..
Immediately on his Eminence  taking his seat. .  ode  was beautifully delivered, the young lady to whom the task had been entrusted speaking the lines with a clear, bright, and penetrating voice which made every word ring through the large halls.  and as the chorus was numerically and vocally strong and the solo voices excellent, the success of the cantata was well nigh perfection. .. The programme was a model of refined taste; the pieces were few (eight in all, exclusive of the ode and cantata) but every item was a 'gem of purest ray serene'. The instrumental music, which consisted of performances on two, four, and five pianos, was distinguished by exquisite delicacy of touch, fine grace of expression, and perfect technical accuracy. Of the five selections played, all of them high class . - - the most brilliant were Suppe's ever charming 'Poet and Peasant', and a noble march - . - dashed off with great verve and spirit by ten clever hands. In what may be styled the literary line, the recitation by three young ladies of an academic 'Discourse on Education', - - - was something very much out of the common
A scene from Moliere's 'Le Bourgeois gentilhomme' was given by two pupils in a surprisingly bright and intelligent manner - - - (During an address to Cardinal Moran by a senior pupil) six little fairies representing Erin and Australia advanced and drew aside the green and gold banner of the Hibernian Society which had been hiding from view a magnificent marble statue of the Apostle of Ireland - . . All were exquisitely dressed, the representatives of Ireland being in green and gold, with bright gold shamrocks glittering on the delicate silk and the thin web-like veils, while the Australians were clad in native blue and pearl ornaments . . . It was a prettily picturesque tableau as the bright-faced little fairies in their glittering apparel stood at either side of the pale white marble image -
The presentation of the prizes, which were numerous and valuable, followed . . . The exhibition of work in the adjoining hail was the largest and best in the history of the convent - . - all the exhibits, whether in needlework, drawing, painting, or any other department of art, being to a really good standard. Some of the crayon drawings were worthy of being hung in our national art gallery.
