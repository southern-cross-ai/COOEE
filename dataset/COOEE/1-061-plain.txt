A school is now establishing on a very extensive plan, for the reception of all orphans, and other children whose parents are not proper for such a charge, under the management of the Govr and a Committee - these children are to be entirely secluded from the other people - and brought up in habits of religion and industry - some branches of manufactories will be by means of this seminary put on foot particularly making linnen and woollen cloths the latter to be procured from the Fleece of a remarkable fine breed of Spanish Sheep already in the Country - and the former from the Flax which grows spontaneous in the Woods. This with their education and the Boys learning different Trades, and the Girls Housewifery and the use of the needle, will be full employment. - This arrangement gives me great satisfaction - as there are now above a thousand children in the place. I cannot help looking forward to the time when the young Men will become useful members of Society and the Women faithful and industrious wives. Everyone must hope for our success in so laudable an undertaking - and if no material interruption takes place - we shall soon have it on a permanent establishment - I hope when an opportunity offers to hear from you - it is now fifteen months since we left England, and I have not heard from any Friend I have. - Col. Patersons whole time is totally taken up with his two capacities, particularly under the present circumstances, either hearing evidences, or in the Field with the Men, and I am often lonely enough, and sometimes perhaps fancy things worse than they are - but however with respect to My Dear Sister I am always easy, under your protection I can have no fear -  I have now only to add Col. P. best respects.  f any thing more happens before the sailing of the ship I will mention it to my sister.
