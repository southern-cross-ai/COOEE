Dear Sir 
I write you these few lines to inform you that I received your letter of 29th. July, as also the inclosed lines for Robert Byers, but I am sory to say that I could not forward it to him on account of my not Knowing his address, as he seems to be like some others. That is he does not Know where we live untill he wants somthing, for he Knows my address - but I do not Know his. He left Mr. Parker sore against his masters will, for he was pleased with him and sent me word to that effect. But although I never heared the perticulars yet I beleive it was Mr. John Jefferys fault, and I think they both have repented it - so now that I have named this young man, I must tell you little about him also. 
After he left Robert Byers he tramped the country as long as could, and was at Bendigo on his rounds, and came here hard up as they call it here, and on his Fathers account and on yours also, my bed and board was very welcome to him, and I done my endeavour to get him a situation which he got in a very fine establishment in this place, it was the place in which we all deal. But I must say that he has not proved as he promised to do.  For I gave him a very great caution and advice before he went, and he made very fine promises but he left without ever telling me of it, although I was in the Store on the same night that he left. His wages was two pounds ten shillings per week and board and lodging, and if he had acted the man as he promised to do he might have been there for years. I have been makeng inquiry into the cause of his leaving, but there was nothing to his dishonesty only carlessness and thoughtlessness or rather lazyness - I did feel very much grieved on his account and on his Fathers also, but alas poor fellow himself will be the sufferer. 
I have not heard of him since and I have a letter for him to my care from a town called Kyenton, between this and Melbourne and I will Keep it till he calls for it as he will very likly give us a call some day or other. But I have done my duty and so has my Mrs. and I am glad it's no worse, but I think we have done. Indeed I would have wrote to you by last mail but I depended on him, as he promsed to come up night after night, and write to you, as he could handle the pen in a superior manner to me and of course he could indite it better, but alas the mail closed and he came not. I would have sent papers also but waiting on him. He also promised to send a paper in which was the advertisement for Robert Byers as he did try to find him out, and wrote to Creswick and to Melbourne but he said he got no answer before he left. I will very likely send you a few lines some time that he sent to me although the distance was scarsley as far as from your house to the turn of the Newtownards road, and by it you may judge - it may be I might send it in this one. 
You spoke of not Knowing William Boyces address but you may have seen it before this time, as I Know that they wrote by last mail but I think that Scorpian hill Taradale will find him out. I will likily send some papers with this. I cannot give you any information about Mr. Thomas Brooks as he went away along with William Patton, in the exploring party and we have not heard of him since. You will see by this last dated paper that they are got to the River Darling, and the names of them all is there but his is not there. That name Blook  is an Indian. 
John Regan is well he is working on the railway down towards Melbourne, but I think he will soon be up here. All the others of our family are all in good health. James and Nathaniel is gone to a new rush about 20 miles from us, at a place call'd Yandoit. Thomas is just returnd from a visit down to the heads where we lived the first 2 years. He rode his own horse down and up again. Alexander is still up in New South Wales as yet but they were all well the last word we got from them. 
You spoke of John Nivin saying I neve wrote to him now, but I sent him the last letter about 9 months ago but he might not get it, at any rate I sent him another about a fortnight ago, with this plea but we have got no answer to it yet. I would certinly write more oftener, but it takes me a long time and at the best I am not good at it and you could not think how buisy I am I may say night and day. 
But Remember my very large garden, and although I bost a little it is a wonder to many to see it. Numbers stands with their hands on the fence looking over with astonishment. If I was to send you a list of all things that I have in it - it would surprse you. But I have also to fill my time at my daily work of digging besides, from eleven oclock in the morning to six at night as we are five in a party but we are making very little wages this long time. But we have made a good deal of the garden this year and the boys is begining to be a help to me, but we still Keep them at the School as much as possable, but I have Kept Robert at home this some time. But this will weary you so I will draw a tang  on it. 
We certinly are very glad to hear the news you send to us of any event that may happen in or about the old town, for all these things be them ever so trifling is precious to us. In fact we get very little but by you, for which I feel very much obliged. Now sir I will draw this long yarn to a close. Agnes wishes to be Kindly Rememered to your Mother and to all inquiring friends and beleive me to be your sincear friend
