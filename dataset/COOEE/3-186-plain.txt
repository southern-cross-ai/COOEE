"SIR,- As it has to-day been intimated to me that, notwithstanding my, yesterday, declining an overture by telegram on behalf of various parties in the electoral districts of the Upper Hunter to bring me forward at the ensuing election in opposition to Mr. John Robertson, a nomination of me will nevertheless be persisted in, will you allow me, probably with the result of saving a contest and some expense, to say, through your columns, that I am not a candidate for the representation of the Hunter? I have telegraphed that, even if elected, I shall decline to sit. Of course I did this with every feeling of gratitude to the gentlemen who did me the honour of placing such confidence in me. I have, in fact, no desire for the present to return to political life. I make this statement for two reasons - firstly, that it has, both at and since the general election, been too largely the practice to bring me forward, rashly and injudiciously, without in most instances consulting me, and in some against my will, under circumstances of disadvantage, where a person of far higher pretensions than the humble writer of these lines could not have a chance of succeeding, - the disadvantage to one who has once tried to serve his country faithfully, and who hopes some time hereafter to be of use to her, is obvious. and, secondly, for far higher reasons. I take a very different view of what is due to those men who, at a crisis, undertake to work our new institutions to that of Mr. John Robertson and those who in company with him from the very first hour of my honoured friend Mr. Forster's ministerial existence did their dear utmost to thwart him, to check and restrain his every effort. 
" Even if I had the certainty of being returned, - and with Mr. John Robertson at the Hunter few men in this country would have such a certainty, - Mr. Robertson having taken upon himself to attempt the government of the country, I should be sorry in any way to interfere with him in the achievement of his onerous task. The man who accepts the responsibilities of the present hour is entitled to a large measure of favour on all sides, though it is possible that this view is more generous than constitutional; and I may add that I am far from believing that Mr. Robertson's own public conduct renders him worthy of either forbearance or generosity. A severer code of ethics than I care to look at just now would deny the giving grace to an individual, even at a 'crisis,' when that crisis was brought about by his own discreditable conduct and shameless abnegation of the ordinary rules of political morality. 
"I am, Sir, 
"Your Obedient Servant, 
"D. H. DENIEHY.
