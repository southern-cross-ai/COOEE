My Dear Father
I take the favourable oppertunity in answering your kind letter dated June 11th 1861 which gave us great pleasure to hear from you Stepmother Brothers & Sisters being in a perfect State of health. Likewise we are very glad to hear from our friends & relations and our old neighbours to hear that they were all well & doing well, thanks be to God. 
My dear Father My Sister Bridget is married & gone up the country. I have not herd from her for the last 5 months. I hope I will by the next country mail. Patt Neylon is gone a good way up the country. He is hired with a  squatter that Keep a Dairy and a large farming buisness. We got a letter of late from him. He said he was doing well and will shortly come down to see us.  Michl Carrigg & family are very well and are doing first rate. They tell me that Mary Carrigg is a clever looking girl & well educated. She is one of the leading girls that  sings in Brisbane chappel in the choir. She is well licked by the Bishop & Priests of that Town. I got no letter from Thomas Doolan of late. The last time he wrote to me he had a notion of going to the Diggings. I dont know whether he is gone or not. 
Dennis McMahon & Brother James are in New-Zeland. I received two letters from there. They come from the East Indias there to quell the rebels or (Mourees) that made ware with the British authorities. They are natives of N. Zealand & very strong & neumorous race of people. It would take me to long to tell you how the war commenced between them. There was a good many European soldiers killed there before the strong forces arrived. I hope I will have the pleasure of seeing them one of these days for they are sure of coming to Sydney. 
My dear Father, it is a sad affair about the wars in America. There is a good many true hearted Irishman killed or wounded there, and by all accounts from the last mail from home they have no thoughts of having an end of it. I expect it will do a great deal of harm to Ireland for there was a good deal of money coming from there to Ireland. Let me know as soon as you can if you heard from America or did Mary & Husband come out of it. I am uneasy for not hearing from them for this long time Past. 
My dear Father this Place is not turning out so good as people thought. There is a great many people here often out of Employment. There is no large or extensive works carried on here that would take the influx of the labouring Class but at the same time there is a good deal of Blame on themself. They are frightened to go out of the Towns or go up the Country in to the interiour. 
It is very hot here at the present time. Summer is commencing on and scarcely you could bare a light coat on going to church. I mean to inform you that we are in good Health at the Presant time and I am working in the same place as yet and likely not to leave it. The children & Bridget are well thank God. 
My dear Father you have a large Family and I expect you will soon have good healp of your own. I am very much pleased at Theadys writing and was very glad for the newspaper he had scend me. You could not credit what pleasure I get in reading home papers. I had to conceal that Paper from many peopel until I read it over. I lend it to upwards of 20 persons and then they were not done. I have scend him a newspaper by this mail and twoo to Mr. Shannon. I will scend Mr Shannon one every month if he likes it. I hope Mr. Shannon and Mrs are well, likewise Martin Neylon wife & family My uncles and Aunts and all relations Neighbours, &, &. I scend them my best love and respects. 
Actualy my Dear Father I fancy I am speaking to you verbaly while I am writing this scroll to you but my grife I am not. O wouldnt I be glad if I could have one glance at Derry People and especaly you dear Father and family. Good by. I expect I will never see yea. 
Thomas Murry & Austin Fitzpatrick are the twoo onely Neighbours I care for in this Town. They are working in the one place with me they are strong men. I can tell you it would be hard to speake an angry word to a Co. Clare man in this Town. Mrs Murry is going to write home to her mother by the next mail that will be in a months time. The English mail leaves Sydney on 22nd of each month. I hope Theady will be kind enough as to scend me a paper as often as he can. I must conclude those few lines with my love to you dear Father Stepmother Brothers and Sisters and all enquiring friends & relations from 
your loving son 
Ml. Normile 
May the Lord spare you long lives over your Family. Belive this to the constant prayer of your loving son
