I am busy making my paddocks sheep-proof in hopes of getting sheep this season and should they do well, and the dingoes keep away, I may pull along all right. It is strange that since I wrote to Dick the said dingoes got into Geoff's paddocks and in two nights killed 36 ewes and lambs and more are so badly bitten that the blow flies will kill them too. He has poisoned one dog and other baits have disappeared so it may be sometime before he gets another visit. The blow-flies are a kind of big blue bottle and are so bad at the beginning of the winter and summer that they blow the sheep's wool and the maggots, unless constantly attended to, will eat the sheep alive. So you see a farmer fights nature out here in all forms. As the land gets opened up these things get less as the fly likes the dense bush
