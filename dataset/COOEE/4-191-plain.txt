 You will be sorry to learn that Miss Knubley and her three sisters have all been laid up with typhoid fever. They all had to take their beds about four weeks ago. I am happy to say however that they are all on a fair way to recovery. I had a letter today written by Miss Knubley herself to the effect that the doctor said that the fever had left them all now and they were allowed a little change in their diet. Of course when the fever was on them they were only allowed liquid food such as mutton broth, chicken broth, water and milk and soda and milk. Miss Knubley is just able to sit up in bed and write a short note with a pencil. It is very shaky yet. It seems that they have not had the fever in its worst form but, even so, it is bad enough when four patients are laid up in one house. I hope however that the worst is over now and only time is necessary to restore them to health again. 
You will be glad to know that James is likely to start business on his own account in one of the best provincial towns of the colony, the city of Sandhurst on the line between this and Melbourne about 56 miles from Echuca and 100 from Melbourne. 
All being well he is to be married about Easter, I think Tuesday 8 April. Of course that is as far as I know just now but no doubt he will have given you all particulars himself before this. 
We have made arrangements that William and Sarah, John and myself will try and be in Melbourne on the date of the ceremony, all being well. It might be a long time before we would have a chance of all meeting together again so it would be well to embrace this event as a suitable occasion for a mass meeting of the Maxwell family in the Southern hemisphere. You know this will be the first time we have all met at once. 
James wrote lately that it was their intention to invite Miss Knubley but I am afraid that she will not be strong enough to go. I would like very much that she could. We will see how things go before that. 
The last word I had from John, a few days ago, he said that he had not been so bright for the last week or two. I attribute that to the extreme heat of the weather. It has been trying on strong people so he must feel it. I know that it pulled me down a good deal. In fact everybody is or rather was, complaining of exhaustion. The month of January and part of February was one continuous heat, said to be the greatest heat for continuity at a high temperature for the last fifty years. There has been individual hotter days by several degrees but not lasting more than two or three days. 
John is getting on with his operations fairly. He has a ready market for what potatoes and vegetables he can spare, of which he can grow abundantly in his garden. The mare has foaled and it is a fairly good one.  When last I heard from William they were well but feel the heat a good deal. There is some talk of a woollen mill being started in Echuca on the limited company lines. I hope it may be a success
