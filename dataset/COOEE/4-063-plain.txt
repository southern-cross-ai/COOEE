 as regards the farming I had a notion of going back to New England about February or March but there has been a land bill past that is a great barrier to the setteler ; it is in favour of the squatter; their is a great many of them in power so the make the laws to suit themselves like the landlords of Ireland, but if I went back to New England there is a mate of mine their, we would have leaced a run and put cattle on it but it is very chancey for your cattle dying in a dry season.
