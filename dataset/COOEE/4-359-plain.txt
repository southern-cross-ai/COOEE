Supreme Court, Sydney,
November 16th, 1896.
Sir, - I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter, in which you state that the Bathurst Federation League contemplate holding a Convention for the purpose of discussing the principle of Federation, and regret that, owing to stress of work, my reply has been somewhat delayed. I wish to express my entire sympathy with the objects which your League has in view, and shall be glad to do anything in my power to promote so worthy a cause. I shall watch with much interest the progress of the Convention at Bathurst, and hope that some means may ultimately be devised for securing the desired end, as to the expediency of which, I think, all parties are agreed, however much they may differ as to the details of the scheme to be adopted. The colonies have now reached a stage of development which renders the adoption of some form of Federal Government essential to their true progress, and I trust that mere provincialism will not prevent a union, from which, I think, all classes in the community would derive benefit.
I have the honour to be, Sir,
Your obedient Servant,
G. B. Simpson, J.
T. A. Machattie, Esq., President Bathurst Federation League.
