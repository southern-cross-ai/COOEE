He would not enter further into his views on the subject than to say, that he thought the time had arrived, when the long agitated emancipist question might be dropped, and that it would be unwise, in the new bill, to have any clause whatever upon the subject. These opinions, he would observe, were not new to him, as might be found upon reference to the archives of Downing street, although he had to bear the odium of being opposed to the emancipist interest.
