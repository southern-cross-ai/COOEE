 I saw M. Hawthorn today. He was telling me he had got a situation. (I think he said in Launceston. If so it is in Tasmania. It is an out of the world place to my mind. Tasmania is very slow going place and not at all energetic like the rest of the colonies) in a hardware house. As I am not quite sure don't say much about it lest I made a blunder. He (Mr. Hawthorn) is very sociable here and stops and shakes hands with either Hugh or I when he meets us but Australia and the crossing of the line makes a great change on people's sociability.
