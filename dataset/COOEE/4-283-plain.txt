 we have joined the cavalry or as you would call it the soldiers but I may tell you we are high class. We are volunteers and are drilled two nights per week and two hours during our half holiday which is on horseback. The government provide us with uniform which is blue with yellow stripes. We provide horse, saddle and riding boots. I might say this is the only recreation or amusement we have and we are paid for it  I have completed my second year here and am just taking stock. I hope it will turn out well. I have every reason to think so although business in general has been very quiet.
