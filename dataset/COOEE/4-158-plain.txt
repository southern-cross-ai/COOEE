John and me started for Sale Gippsland by the early train on Thursday; arrived there about 1 o'clock; took the boat which plys on the Gippsland lakes between Sale and Bairnsdale. There are three lakes which we pass through on the trip. We arrived at Bairnsdale about 8.30 pm stopped there all night and started next day at 7.30pm by coach for a small township called Bruthen; arrived there about 10 o'clock same evening.  On Saturday morning we again started by coach at 5 o'clock and got to Tambo Crossing at 9 o'clock in time for breakfast. We were now at our journey's end. We soon found Mr. Wilson the young man that has taken up a block of land there. John and I started off to have a look at the lands available for selection. We were rather disappointed as we found it all extremely hilly indeed mountainous in some places. 
I was obliged to return on my homeward journey on Monday afternoon so had I only Saturday, Sunday and Monday morning to look around but in that time we came across nothing sufficiently tempting. John stayed behind for a couple of days or so to have a further look but I am inclined to think he would come across nothing to suit.
