Often since my wee wife was taken from me I have wished that I were dead and laid beside her. I have nothing to live for now no interest to work for. Before I did not mind how hard the work was or how long the hours, so long as I was earning something that would help to make my Lillie more comfortable or provide for her future in case anything happened to me. I sometimes feel as if I could not bear to stay in Melbourne, there are so many associations that continually remind me of the past. If I see an opening on a station in some of the other Colonies I think I will try for it and go there. 
 I have nothing more to write about now. I think in fact I wrote more for the sake of having someone to talk to than that I had anything to write, but I am lonely and I have not what I could call a friend here and I do feel so lonely, so completely isolated at times that I wish all were ended.
