No decree shall be made for a divorce a mensa et thoro, but in all cases in which a decree for a divorce a mensa et thoro might, before the operation of the said Statute 20 and 21 of Victoria, chapter 85, have been pronounced by any Ecclesiastical Court in England, the court now by this Ordinance established may pronounce a decree for a judicial separation, which shall have the same force and the same consequences as a divorce a mensa et thoro formerly had.

Whereas from the speedy decomposition consequent on death in this climate, it is advisable to make some provision that will admit of the early interment of bodies on which it may be necessary to hold inquests when death may have happened on a Sunday, or at such time before or under such circumstances as may have prevented the holding of an inquest on some earlier day:  Be it therefore enacted by His Excellency the Governor of Western Australia and its dependencies, by and with the advice and consent of the Legislative Council thereof: - 
1. That in every such case it shall and may be lawful for the coroner to summon, assemble, and hold an inquest on Sunday, for the purpose of viewing, examining, or dissecting the body, and thereupon such body may be interred, and the coroner may adjourn the said inquest to any subsequent day for the further investigation of the matter.

3. And whereas it is expedient to make provision for supporting coroners' inquisitions and for preventing the same from being quashed on account of technical defects, it is further enacted that no inquisition, found upon any inquiry in the nature of a coroner's inquest, nor any judgment recorded upon or by virtue of any such inquisition shall be quashed, stayed, or reversed because any juror or jurors shall have set his or their mark or marks to any such inquisition, instead of subscribing his or their name or names thereto, nor because any such mark or marks is or are unattested, provided the name or names of such juror or jurors is or are set forth, nor because any juror or jurors has or have signed his or their Christian name or names by means of an initial or partial signature only, and not at full length, nor because of any erasures or interlineations appearing in any such inquisition, unless the same shall be proved to have been made therein after the same was signed, nor for nor by reason of any such inquisition not being duly sealed or written upon parchment, nor because the coroner and the jury did not all view the body at one and the same instant, provided that all viewed the body at the first sitting of the inquest; and in all or any of such cases of technical defects as are hereinbefore mentioned, it shall be lawful for any Judge of the Supreme Court or for any Judge of Assize or Gaol Delivery, if he shall so think fit upon the occasion of any such inquisition being called in question before him, to order the same to be amended in any of the respects aforesaid, and the same shall be forthwith amended accordingly. 
4. That the term 'coroner' shall include any person lawfully acting in such capacity, and legally exercising the powers and performing the duties of a coroner.
