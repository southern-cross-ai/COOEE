Convict Ship, 377 Tons, 4 Guns, of London
It is often our sad Duty to relate of the enormities perpetrated by the Convicts on board Transports during their Voyages from England, that the Behaviour of the Convicts on the Occasion of the Capture of the Ship, Francis and Eliza, by an American Privateer off the Island of Madeira, on her passage hither, is more than astonishing. It has been stated by the Commander and Surgeon of that Ship, as well as by Mr. Frederick Garling, the Solicitor, a Passenger, that both the Male and Female Convicts on board of her, conducted themselves with great Discretion, Moderation and Decency at the time of the Capture, and whilst subsequent to the Ship being restored.
The Francis and Eliza, Captain Harrison, arrived at Sydney on Monday, 7th. August, 1815, having departed from Ireland with 54 Male and 70 Female Prisoners on board; two of the former and four of the latter description died on the passage, which for its tedious length, and other vicissitudes they were exposed to render it a matter of especial wonder that the mortality was so happily limited.
She sailed from Cork the 5th. December in convoy with the Canada (which arrived here last week), and had the misfortune to be captured on the 4th. January, by the Warrior, American Privateer, Captain Champlin, pierced for 22 guns, but not all mounted, and carrying 160 men.
Captain Harrison was removed on board the privateer, and detained many hours, but was afterwards liberated and restored to his own ship. His private losses are very severe indeed, as are those of Mr. West, ship's Surgeon, from whom an investment of a thousand pounds was wholly taken, together with most of his wearing apparel, surgical instruments, and the ship's medicine chest, which latter loss, but for the favour of Providence, might have been followed by the most fatal consequences to the numerous persons on board.
Having also taken out all her arms and ammunition, the Americans left her to her fate, but only after several of the crew of the Francis and Eliza had deserted to the enemy. The Prisoners no longer submitted to the usual restraints, but nethertheless conducted themselves with exemplary Propriety, dividing themselves into watches, and performing the duties of the vessel at a time, we are sorry to relate, the Ship's Company themselves had become refractory and insubordinate.
The Crew almost a score in number seized upon the spirits and other liquors, which were treated as common plunder, and the most dreadful scenes of riot and intemperance prevailed, until their arrival at Santa Cruz, five days later. But for the steady conduct of the Male Convicts, it is certain that the Females on board would have received the unwelcome and lewd attentions of the debauched seamen, who on several occasions set the Ship on fire during their drunken frolics.
At Santa Cruz, the Captain received every friendly assistance from Mr. Duplex, Chief Consul, who thought it prudent to impose a ten days quarantine upon the vessel, but took the necessary means to restore good order, which was better accomplished by the transfer of the most disorderly of the Crew, including the Chief Officer, to a King's Ship, then lying there.
At Teneriffe the Francis and Eliza, re-joined the Canada, which had had the better fortune to escape the vigilance of the American Cruizers, and under the convoy of the Ulysses, Frigate, went with her to Senegal, thence Goree, and thence Sierra Leone. Here a detachment of the Royal African Corps, commanded by Ensign Alt, joined the Francis and Eliza, to become the military guard, and the two Ships then proceeded in company to the Cape of Good Hope, and arrived here without further incident.
