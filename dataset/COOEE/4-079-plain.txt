I am greatly surprised to see the crop looking so well when I consider the dryness of the past few months. There is one thing, if they have a bad crop they have no rent to pay and no landlord to fear and they can live for one season without any return from their own land as they could go and work in other districts where crops are good, that is supposing they never had saved anything from former years  the land up here is very good being very well adapted for growing wheat and it's grazing capabilities are very good. 
 It will be much better for James's health to be going up and down to Bangor and Mr. Peters will be good company for him. He will be able to go home every Sunday and to see his girl as often as he had a fancy. You know it is a grand privilege to have such a luxury which either you nor I have had the pleasure indulging in since we came to the colony. Perhaps you have for all that I know.
