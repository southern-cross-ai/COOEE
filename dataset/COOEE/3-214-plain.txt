Dear Sir,
I Must trouble you once more to do me a favour. We are all in good health at present as I hope this will find you. My Brother in law William Boyce Sends a Check for the Sum of twenty-five Pounds £25 on the Bank of Australasia in this letter for the purpose of bringing his Sister & her son out to this Country Ellen Thompson & her son Robert. I think it is better to Bring them out in one of the passenger Ships as it would delay them too long to wait to the Emigration would be open again. 
Mr Orr you will be Kind enough to tell her not to bring anything with her but what she will Stand in need of on the passage as it would cost as Much to bring them up to the Diggings as they would be worth. Besides they would be a Burden to her on the passage. When her Brother William & Johny Regan Came out the Sort of Provisions that the found best to answer was flour potatoes a few salt Herrings and a little Ham. Now these things she Could Bring from home, Say - 0.5 Cwt potatoes 30 lb flour four or five Doz Salt Herrings & a little Ham, and to have these things put in her day Box and to have it in her Berth, so that she can get it any time on the passage. The Ships Allowance is plenty for a passenger But the above named articles is rather Scarce. 
And Sir - if You Could get any person to see her & the child togather with the Boxes placed on Board of the Ship, Suppose she Sails from Liverpool, and to pay him for his trouble I think it would be better as she is not Much accustomed to these things. If the Amt in this check is not sufficient to cover all expences If you be Kind enough to supply her with anything that she might be deficient of as Soon as I hear from you I shall return you the Amt by the Next Mail. Sir you will be Kind enough to write as soon as you agree for the passage and let us Know the Name of the Ship and the day she Sails so that we can be on the look out for her Arrival, and send the Amt in full of what she may be deficient of and what ever funds you have supplyd her with at any other time. I would Have wrote sooner only waiting to see If we could obtain a passage for her & the Boy by the Emigration System but the passages was all taken up. 
Wm Orr Gowdie was in my place on last Sunday and he told me that Robert Hutten was in a Company near Ballarat. I heard of Alexander Clark and that he was in Mr Gowdies a few days ago and that he was well and his Brother Also. I heard nothing of Mr Jeffry scince I wrote last. Thomas Brooks is driving a waggon on the roads. I see him frequently. Robert Byers was down at my place scince I wrote last. I heard about 3 weeks-ago that James Kerr was at Malmsbury. Johny Regan & My Brother John & I is always working togather. 
My Mother in law Mrs. Boyce will be for ever obliged to you for your trouble that you have had with her Daughter on other Occasions as well as now. I think I have Mentioned all particulars Concerning her Passage & the rest you will please do as seems to you best. I will Conclude with Sending our best respects to you & Father & Mother and all enquiring Friends 
and I remain Yr. Scincere Friend,
