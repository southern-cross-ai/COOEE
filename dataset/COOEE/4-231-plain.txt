Sarah having got a block of 700 acres she has been noticed to pay part of her survey fees now and with James getting married and going into business he was not able to assist John so I have been helping them to get theirs rung and fenced as if not done in three years they would have to forfeit and lose your improvements. You see although we have so much land it is all bush, or you would understand it better by looking at the inside of Mountstewart or Lord Dufferin's demesne only the trees are box and gums from 12 to 36 inches in diameter. Many gentlemen at home would be proud to have such bush. Of course we can sell our rights at any time as this is the way we are investing our money. We had a letter from James last week in which he mentioned that David's wife had got a son three weeks old but supposed we had heard of it. They have been very kind to both David and her and brought up Mrs. Ricketts to attend her to save paying a nurse which costs from 25s. 0d. to 30s. 0d. per week. But he says she is very ignorant like as if he had come out of the moss.
