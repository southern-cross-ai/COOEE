The charge being most clearly proved, she was sentenced to be put in the stocks 8 hours, at two different periods, with an iron collar placed upon her neck, and to be imprisoned in the county gaol for 3 months. The complaint was peculiar aggravating, this woman having only been released from prison a few days back on a similar case.
John Gwynn, a free man, was fined five pounds, for attempting to inveigle the above woman from her place.
We trust this example will be a warning to all young women who are assigned as servants in this Island; and cause them to remain peaceable and contented in the situation allotted them by Government, and not to be seduced by those who in a short time may leave them friendless and distressed.
