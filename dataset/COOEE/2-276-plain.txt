Bourke-street, with the very laudable intention, it was whispered, of carrying into effect the commission entrusted to them by Mr Edward Curr at the nomination on Thursday, and for the due performance of which he had called upon them to swear, namely, to tar and feather the newspaper alderman. Finding, however, that the worthy alderman was not exactly in a humour to meet their wishes, and observing a very significant demonstration on the part of the mounted police, both black and white, the mob adjourned to the front of the Mechanics' Institute, when the Returning Officer Alderman Russell announced his intention of making the successful candidate known at 11 o'clock this day. The mob refusing to disperse and becoming excessively unruly, the Police Magistrate was compelled to read the Riot Act, and ordered them to disperse, but without effect; and it ultimately became necessary for the troopers to charge in and clear the area in front of the building. As night drew on, the mob, who had been clearly organised for the purpose, formed themselves into bodies of from one to two hundred and paraded the streets, breaking the windows of the parties obnoxious to their interest. Amongst the sufferers are Mr Baker, Imperial Inn; Mr Roberts, Union; Mr Cantlin, Elephant and Castle; Mr Young, grocer, etc, etc, etc.; and strange to say, the windows of Mr Williamson, the draper, were also broken, although he (still more strange to say) was a staunch supporter of Mr Edward Curr, which, when the mob understood, they politely apologised, saying, it was a mistake.
Later in the evening a mob amounting to a thousand, proceeded to the house of Mr Green, the auctioneer in Elizabeth-street, who had conscientiously given his vote to the Mayor, and announced their intention of burning or pulling down his house, and thereupon commenced to break open the shutters and smash the windows, actually wrenching the iron bars which guarded the windows till they broke like pipe staples. Mr Green and the owner of the premises, Mr Greenaway, with Mr Green's family were the only inmates of the house at the time, and considering their lives in danger Mr Green threatened to fire on the mob if further violence was attempted. Disregarding or perhaps disbelieving the threat the ruffians persisted, until Mr Green, finding the shutters giving way, fired through the door and shot one of the mob, the bullet passing through his neck and wounding him seriously but not mortally. Another shot fired passed over the heads of the crowd and wounded a gentleman named Curie, a clerk in the employ of Alderman Russell who had been attracted to the spot by the disturbance, in the fleshy part of the foot, the ball passing clear through and carrying portions of the boot with it.  Shortly after this Captain Lewis and his company of the 80th arrived, and with fixed bayonets cleared an area in front of the house, when Mr Green and his shopman surrendered themselves and they were conveyed to the watch-house for protection. After several charges made by the troopers and by the foot soldiers, the mob gradually dispersed, loudly and bitterly regretting that Green was out of their reach as they would have 'eaten his heart'. A patrol of the mounted police paraded the town during the night, and by that means much outrage was no doubt prevented. There is not the slightest doubt that these and many other disgraceful outrages were contemplated several days previous, in the event of Mr Curr being unsuccessful at the election.
