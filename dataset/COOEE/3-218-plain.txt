And we had no right to complain of their having done so, provided that New South Wales obtained the revenue of the dutiable goods which Victoria sent into this colony. If Melbourne, from her geographical position or from the superior enterprise of her merchants, could supply goods at a cheaper rate to the inhabitants of this colony, she was entitled to the advantage she would reap from it; but that should, he thought, be accompanied at the same time with a due regard to our rights and our revenue. This evil had occurred from the very commencement of the separation of the two colonies, and almost naturally so, because prior to separation the inhabitants of the southern part of New South Wales, bordering on the Murray, had long had a trading acquaintance with Melbourne. The attention of the Government of the day was called in 1853 to the large amount of dutiable goods that were being brought from the colony of Victoria into New South Wales, and paid no duty in this colony. The consequence was, that in 1855 Border Custom-houses were established, respectively, in the colony of Victoria as well as in New South Wales, on the River Murray, and these continued in operation only for a short period. There were several seizures made of goods which were held to be contraband, and a considerable quantity of goods paid double duty, the only alternative being confiscation. The harassing nature of this proceeding was felt to be so grievous in that part of the territory that the Government of this colony communicated with that of the neighbouring colony, and they mutually agreed that the custom-houses on the River Murray should be abolished, and in 1855 that took place.  At the same time, the enterprise of a gentleman in the neighbouring colony - Captain Cadell - showed that the rivers of New South Wales - the Murray and the Murrumbidgee - were open to steam navigation. As the goods came from South Australia by these steamers, it was evident that some arrangements must be entered into to protect the revenue of this colony. And that treaty being made with South Australia, it was arranged that the customs should be collected on the Murray, and be divided equally between the colonies of South Australia, Victoria, and New South Wales. This arrangement was put an end to on account of the great loss which it entailed upon New South Wales, in consequence of the inequality of its tariff. The customs were then collected on the tariff of New South Wales, as respected goods entering this colony, but the loss to New South Wales was still very great. It was the desire of some that the revenue of New South Wales should be protected on the border by the seizure of such dutiable goods on the frontier as were being passed into this colony without payment of duty, it being supposed that the result of such a course would be to ensure the due protection of the revenue in those parts. But he thought that it would, on consideration, be felt to be much more desirable that every expedient should be tried before any such course should be adopted - one which could not but cause a considerable amount of individual hardship and distress. Under these circumstances it was suggested that steps should be taken to bring about one uniform tariff of the whole. It might possibly be supposed that the Government of South Australia would be likely to go into the proposed conference with one particular view on the matter to be discussed (hear, hear), and that the Government of that colony was in favour of the principle of free distillation, although they would not press it to the exclusion of a more beneficial policy. He thought he was justified in coming to that conclusion of the view taken by South Australia by the course taken in the Parliament of that colony. In regard to the subject now under consideration on the 18th July, 1862, in the Assembly at Adelaide the Colonial Treasurer moved the following resolution: "That, in the opinion of this House, it is desirable that the colony of South Australia should be represented by delegates at any conference to be held at Melbourne on the subject of tariffs and steam postal communication." An amendment was moved upon this resolution, to the following effect - "And that previous to any delegate being appointed the Government submit to the House a scheme of taxation based on the principle of granting free distillation at once in this colony." This amendment went to a division and was negatived by 19 to 5, showing that whatever their views might be they would even sacrifice this favourite scheme for the sake of accomplishing a greater good in the attainment of a uniform tariff, and he believed it would be found that for the common good South Australia would forego any predilection of the kind.  No doubt, in a conference of this kind, one common purpose could not be arrived at except by the mutual concessions of all parties interested. He believed that each felt the evil of the present system so acutely that they would go into the conference with a determination to arrive at a resolution to accomplish what all must desire, a uniform tariff.
