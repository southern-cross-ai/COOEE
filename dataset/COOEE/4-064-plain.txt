Each driver has only to drive a few hours every day and wash his coach twice a week (I will have my board too). If I do not get this crib I will likely get on a sheep station after a little.
There is a Mr Finlay who I got an introduction to by the Rev. Robinson who said he would try and get me a crib on a station but he advised me to take a month or six weeks before commencing work. I went to Dr. Bird of Melbourne before coming up here and he examined my chest and give me a recipe. He also weighed me, I was only 1st 3lbs without coat and vest. My light weight was owing to my having diarrhoea for a week which greatly weakened me. However I have not it since.
