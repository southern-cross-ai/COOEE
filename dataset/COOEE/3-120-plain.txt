I cannot go to the University on Sunday. You must have noticed that I evaded giving a direct answer to Dr Woolley's invitation; simply because I determined that I would not go if I could avoid doing so. My reasons are that tho' I know that "the sabbath was made for man and not man for the sabbath" yet I also know that it is "the Lord's day on which we may not think our own thoughts or speak our own words" and from this I gather that I am not excused in doing any work but the real acts of necessity and the labour of worship (if it is such) on that day, and I am quite sure that my going to the University would be neither one nor other. Besides it is communion Sunday and could I overcome the first objection I could not the second - that it would interfere with my receiving the Sacrament. Imperfectly as I may, and do, perform the perfect will of God, I do not deliberately and determinately disobey Him - and so I wish to refuse this invitation.
And now, my dear father, will you be angry with me for this? Shall I tell you how my own wishes are all panting to go, how I long to tread the halls which will be trod by great men here-after? Shall I tell you how I fear your anger, and how I paced backwards and forwards for hours hesitating before I boldly determined to take this course and refuse to go? 
You must not be angry with me for I still read in the Bible which I strive to make my Guide the command 'Obey thy parents' and so if you still wish it I will go and cheerfully tho' not willingly.
I REMAIN, / YOUR'S AFFECTIONATELY / MENIE PARKES
