At 4.55 p.m. bade farewell to Flory (who came with me to the train) and started for Albury. - In the carriage, besides myself, were an elderly gentleman, a young man who looked like a bank clerk, a very handsome young lady of 28, and a little girl of 10. - Fell into a train (an abstract, not a railway train) of melancholy musing - then into a doze - wakened up by guard shouting out, "Twenty minutes here for refreshments." - Found I was at Seymour - went into refreshment room, and had tea and bread and butter: paid 1s / 6d for same. Got into train again, and away we went. - Fell into conversation with old gentleman - talked 16 to the dozen on political, social, personal etc. etc. topics - Old gentn. very intelligent and well informed - After a long talk told him who I was - expression of great surprise and pleasure at meeting the far-famed Journalist and Historian of Australasia - he said he had been hearing of me, reading me, and talking about me for 30 years - told me he was Mr Beeby, a sawmiller of Corowa in N.S.W. - Gave me a hearty invitation to go and stay with him for a month - plenty of good shooting etc. etc. - Promised him I would go when I could find time - Beeby got out at Wangaratta. 
All this time a violent flirtation going on between young lady and gentleman - took them to be a newly married couple out for the honeymoon - little girl asleep, I having made up a bed for her with the rug - after a while discovered that the young flirts had quarrelled - he went to one side of the carriage and stuck his head out of the window, she came over and sat down by me - began to abuse young gentn. as being a brainless fellow, very conceited etc. etc. - said she had been listening to my conversation with old gentn. - began to pile on the flattery - said I did not look more than 50, and would never believe I was 75 - hinted that she was not married, and would be only too happy to have a gentn. for a husband of exactly my age, appearance, and size - said she thought a Travelling Technological Commissioner must be a very high and mighty Personage, with more to the same effect - ended up with fairly popping the question to me!!! - I was in the very act of telling her I should give the question into my most serious consideration, when the train came to a dead-stop and guard shouted "Albury" - awfully glad to hear the sound - shook hands with my ardent admirer (whose name I never asked), took up my traps and bolted - train started - and my fair postulant vanished with it into space - Walking to my hotel recollected that she had never enquired whether I was married or single! - Taken all round, this was the most surprising illustration of feminine bashfulness and reserve I have ever encountered in all my life - Got to my hotel (the Globe) and so to bed. 
Albury to Sydney
May 20th
Wrote up my diary, and posted it, with the 2 newspapers containing the puffs, for home - had much pleasant talk with Mr Plouskowski and a young squatter (married and from Melbourne) named Johnson.
- At 2.45 started in the slow train for Sydney.
With a resolute purpose of escaping the importunate flattery and offers of marriage of handsome young ladies of 28, who may be running about in railways in search of matrimony, I got into the smoking carriage, first class. - Memo. As my free pass had not come, the polite stationmaster at Albury wired to his Superintendent for leave to pass me on, and passed on I was accordingly. - Several civil fellows in the carriage with me, who got out at intervals at passing stations, and were replaced by others equally civil - much talking, some joking, not very much smoking.
Country travelled over before dusk rather uninteresting, and too well known to require describing afresh - was almost startled when I found myself crossing the Murrumbidgee. 
As night came on, talk slackened and smoking increased - to keep up the sociality I rattled off no end of jokes and anecdotes, mostly drawn from the old and well-worn lecture on "National Wit and Humour" - never heard fellows roar with laughter as they did, the jokes being evidently new to them - towards midnight wrapped myself in the rug - night not very cold - dropped asleep at 1.30 and awoke, feeling strange and chilled, at 5.30 - raw morning after a rainy night - everything seemed confused when, about 7.30 we reached Sydney - genial fellow-passenger hired a hansom cab (there seem to be none but hansom cabs in Sydney) and took me and my traps to the Metropolitan Hotel in Castlereagh Street (corner of King St) - had breakfast, a wash, and so to bed.
Got up at 11.30 - dressed and went out to have a first look at Sydney - did not at all recognise the old Sydney which I knew in 1850 - 51 - was struck at once with the stamp of inferiority to Melbourne in everything: streets, people, buildings, etc. - city seems to have been stuck down "every which way" - no regularity, no straight lines of grand buildings as in Melbourne - people all common-looking - could not see the pretty faces that were common enough when I was courting Mamma in 1850 - some of the public buildings very fine, but all in such bad situations that they don't show out to advantage. 
After dinner went for a stroll through the city until tea-time - resolved, as it was Saturday, and I was still in a rather limp condition from the 16 1/2 hours in the railway train, that I would not show myself to any of my grand friends till Monday morning - Nesbit went with some friends to the Agricultural Show at Moore Park, so I was alone - did not meet a soul I knew, except the lad who shaved and trimmed me up generally in a barber's shop in George Street, who knew me well in Melbourne - paid 1s / 3d for the barbering - told the barber that the last time I paid 5d. for a shave in the same shop (or one near it) in the same street was in Decr. 1851 - Barber stared at me as if I had two heads on me - came across a mean and shabby place called the Haymarket, where a very poor sort of a Paddy's Market was going on - everybody looked poor and miserable, not jolly and happy as in the Eastern Market in Melbourne on a Saturday night.
Strolled along George Street, which I could not recollect - admired the English cathedral and Town hall, but both badly situated - was deafened with the noise of the tramcars and omnibuses - tried to find the spots (sacred to memory!) where I first saw, walked with, preached to, courted, and proposed to, Mamma: but could not find one of them - returned to tea at 6 - found Nesbit awaiting me - after tea sat in the smoking room chatting till 9, when he went - encountered my old acquaintance, Habbe the scene painter - had a long talk with him - he had with him a Dane (who talks good English) who is going to England to give evidence in the case of the Claimant, he (the Dane) having sailed with him in the Osprey in 1852 - to bed at 12, in good health and spirits, thanks to God! 
In Sydney Once More
May 22nd - Sunday
A glorious morning, all Australian sunshine and balmy airs - awoke wonderfully refreshed after a good night's rest, and feeling as young as I felt 37 years ago in this very same Sydney - can it be that I am actually an "old fogey" of 67? 
After dinner went down to the quay and went on board the Clontarf steamboat for a trip round the harbour (ticket is.) - fell into conversation with an old sea-captain from Cork - he pointed out to me all the notable spots in the harbour; e.g. the spot where O'Farrell shot the Duke of Edinburgh, the old captain being at the moment in the marquee into which the Prince was carried; the place where the Dun-bar was wrecked; Wentworth's house at Vaucluse, Dalley's house at Manley Beach, and other notable mansions - old sea-captain said he had seen all the fine harbours in the world, and that Port Jackson is, out of all sight, the finest. I fully believed him. Viewed simply as one of Nature's works, it is a masterpiece - I should dearly love to explore it in company with all my loved ones at home, Dr Bevan, and John Ruskin. (Mem. - Perhaps I shall some day.)
After tea wrote up diary and composed a sonnet - meditated deeply over my past life, which really began here in Sydney in 1850, and ended on the mournful 24th January 1887 - In this subdued but serene frame of mind went quietly to bed - have thus been two whole days in Sydney, and as yet have not met anybody from Melbourne.
May 23rd
Another splendid morning - after breakfast went to call on Sir Henry Parkes at the Treasury - found the old man, with his lion-like head and shaggy gray mane, seated at the Premier's table, with a wilderness of papers and official documents scattered about him - had a hearty reception from him, but only stayed a few minutes, as he was in the full swing of work - left him and walked about the city till dinner time - Wynyard Square very fine as a small city park - amazing expansion of the city since I left it in Decr. 1851 - recollect the site where Wynyard Square now stands an open waste, dirty and cheerless, surrounded in part by ranges of filthy old shanties fallen to ruin, which were, I believe, a female penitentiary in the early days - the change is from a pigstye to a palace. 
Dined, and then dressed for the levee - a great crowd there, as I thought, but newspapers reported it a small number only - the usual display of showy official costumes; officers, naval and military, University dons with trencher caps, judges in horsehair and ermine, barristers and clergymen, aldermen in knee-breeches and silk stockings, and some hundreds of common citizens in swallow-tail coats (myself one of them) looking as dignified as they each knew how - had a pleasant smile and hearty shake of the hand from Lord Carrington, a bright-looking, handsome man in gorgeous apparel - thought he looked at me and pressed my hand as if he meant to say, "Mr Blair, I have heard your distinguished name before." But this is only my own egregious vanity, of course - met at the levee only two persons who recognised me; many persons looked at me dubiously, as much as to say, "Think I have seen you before, somewhere." Well, I have been there, once or twice, in my time.
At the levee shook hands with the Premier, and walked with him and the Ministry to the Treasury, an imposing building just outside the gate of Government House - Premier introduced me to two of his colleagues, Mr Roberts, Post-Master General, and Mr Abigail: the former, a youngish, good-looking man, with a cheerful face; the other a small, limping man, with a keenly intellectual face, but not in any way notable - both very civil - Noticed at the levee the gorgeous liveries of the footmen: crimson plush breeches, white silk stockings, blue swallow-tailed coats with enormous buttons etc. - were I to meet one of these Magnificent Personages alone by himself walking along the streets, I should take him to be the Lord High Admiral of Corea at the very least - walking back from the levee admired the beauty of the matchless situation, with the superb views of the Harbour, the luminous skies, the ultramarine tint of the water contrasting with the deep green of the brushwood on the shores - Garden Island, Pott's Point, Fort Denison, etc. etc. - "Where all, save the spirit of Man, is divine" - not that the Sydneyites are any worse than their neighbours.
May 24th
Queen's birthday: all Sydney keeping holiday - weather divine - rambled about after breakfast, admiring the bunting-covered ships in the harbour - cannons firing - street thronged with people, but the crowd much more commonplace in appearance than the Melbourne one - soldiers marching, with bands playing, to grand review at Moore Park - called in at Treasury - found that Parkes had gone to review with Governor - sat for a while in Chief Secretary's library dipping into some of the new books - stood on the balcony outside admiring the superb scenery - went over the Executive Council chamber: very fine, with splendid ornaments, statues, vases etc. etc. - sat in the Governor's and the Chief Secretary's chairs - Treasury chambers really grand, as the work-rooms of a Government ruling a great nation ought to be. 
Left the Treasury and walked into Hyde Park - magnificent change since I lodged here, at this house, No. 1, Burdekin Terrace, in 1850! - I was then a bachelor, very enthusiastic, deeply religious, full of intellectual and religious fervour, an omnivorous reader, utterly careless about worldly affairs or personal prospects, taking Our Blessed Lord's injunctions to His disciples in all their literal meaning. Yet I have survived through 37 years of the battle of life!
And here it was I first met Annie, and fell, at once and for life, deeply in love with that beautiful girl with the loveliest face I ever saw in my life, and who for 36 years (time of courtship included) was my more than other self; for whom alone I lived, and, having lost her, have lost all desire to live. Here is the very green sward upon which we were wont to walk upon sunny afternoons and moonlight nights, talking of life, and love, and God, and Heaven. There is the street up which I was accustomed to turn my steps, as, regularly every evening I set out from my solitary room to visit the cottage on the Surry Hills. There still stands the side-wall of the cottage that marked the corner of the street in which lived my Annie - my Annie even then - and by which waymark I could find my road on even the darkest nights. But the cottage itself is no longer there, and the spot is altogether changed in aspect. A new world, and I a solitary lingerer from the old world that has vanished for ever! Here was the very spot, then the little garden of the cottage, in which I first declared my deep passion, and was accepted, and the first kiss of engagement was given and taken! Ah me! What a throng of memories crowd upon my mind, whilst on this sacred spot I stand and meditate of times and joys departed! Two things only stand conspicuously out amidst the thronging multitude of recollections: the first is, how amazingly beautiful She was; and the second, how passionately I loved Her. Dear and sainted Annie! Never did I meet a second woman in all my long life who awoke in me even the semblance of the same deep, absorbing passion, nor a woman whom, as I have always felt since first I looked upon your lovely and lustrous countenance, I should have asked to be my wife. The universe, for me, possessed only one Annie Grant; and there never was, nor will be, another. 
But these thoughts are too deep and too sacred for utterance in words. Silence and Thought alone are fitting here. Ah me!
In the afternoon I calmed my mind by taking a second trip round the Harbour, in company with Mr Callaghan of Melbourne, whom I met on the quay: and so, back to the hotel to dinner, and to bed.
Wrote up my diary in the morning and posted it - After luncheon went to the Treasury and had a long chat with my old friend Parkes. He gave me a commission to visit all the public institutions in N.S.W. and asked me to come and dine with him next day at his house in Parramatta. Stopped with him - he putting off all public business and refusing to see any of his numerous callers, for, as he said, the pleasure of talking freely with D.B. - Left him setting to work again at 4.30 p.m. - Strolled about the domain (an unrivalled park!) - Mused on the glorious afternoons long, long ago, when I wandered here, enraptured, in company with Her. - After tea went to the old School of Arts, where I lectured in 1850, and read till 10 o'clock - (Memo. The old institution is still substantially the same primitive place it was 37 years ago. The Sydneyites are not now, and never were, an intellectually cultured people.) - back to hotel, and to bed.
