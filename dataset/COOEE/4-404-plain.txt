The former cannot be had in Australia; I mean such as I wore at home and I find the wool is unobtainable in that heavy quality. Perhaps you had better only send socks as I wear under flannel and cotton shirts.  The former are from 4s.6d. to 6s.6d. and the shirts from 3s.6d. to 6s.6d. or even less. I would rather, if you still knit, have one of those white woollen sweaters like Dick used to wear for cricket. I play tennis a good deal and have to pay 12s.6d. for a flannel shirt and it shrinks when washed so that I cannot button the neck. Be sure and put the Ad Valorem duty as low as your conscience will allow. I will get photoed again when I go up to Perth next. Be sure and send me one of yours. 
I expect no more fruit than I can eat myself for four years as we prune hard back for three years after planting to get a stout stem and encourage root growth. A seven year's tree here is the shape of a wine glass and low. Apples are 7d. a lb. here now. I have had very little fruit this year. 
Everything is dear here. Look at wages nothing less than 8s. 0d. a day and of course stores are in proportion. 
The Boers hold out well.
