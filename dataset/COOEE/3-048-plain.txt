Dear Papa,
It would seem so unnatural to me not to write a few words to you now that I have an opportunity of sending to England free of expense; but it would be the most natural thing possible for me to give you a list of wants; which would make me quite your own Daughter again. You speak of there being a balance of our favor from the yearly income therefore please give my Sisters a commission to get me two pairs of stays, two fly away veils very neat and chaste, one black and one white, and a ladylike shawl; also a tasty thing or two to cover the shoulders and give a little ornament and style to in-door dress and that would do to wear at a dinner party or in an evening.  Two thimbles for tiny children and a little useful nick-nack for each and all. The boys should one of them have a thing that contains compasses, ruler, pencils, a knife etc, another a small case with brush, comb and other toilet conveniences on a small scale; none of these things would cost much. The reason of my wanting stays is that I have another to provide for as well as myself, namely Fanny my good and patient help and friend, though we are not just at present in want of them but shall be by the time they come out.
Every thing we get in the Colony is so trumpery, unfashionable, and expensive that England has always been my resource for satisfactory and cheap things. Now that I am going to reside in the more peopled parts of the Colony there is a duty one owes to society that creates more personal wants in the way of decoration that I should like to take the best steps in being provided with though I assure I always mean to be very economical in dress taking great care of every thing (which I always have done) and not having more than is necessary - but I don't expect to escape without a quiz from you which I will take as good naturedly as I hope you will my order - all you have to do is to put this into Anna's or Emma's hands and write me word that you are a very indulgent Papa and I am an incorrigable, naughty, Daughter.
I dared not send you the volume I have written to Mary though if you will be a listener to some portions of it I shall feel most proud, the envelope will be left unsealed in case either my Sisters or yourself would like to know the contents. I have sent the same account to one of Mr. Brown's brothers.
My last letter to you was sent to England by Ann King who has returned to her friends. I did not see her but sent the letter after she was on board.
Dear Papa
Yours ever the same
Eliza Brown
