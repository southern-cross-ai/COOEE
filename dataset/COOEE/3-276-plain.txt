My dear Miss Lewin, 
You may possibly be surprised at hearing from me again but the fact is, that do my very best, I cannot like the Colony or people. More and more do I dislike both & am exceedingly unhappy & heartily weary of it. I have been in my present situation ever since my arrival which will be two years next month and during that time have had more to contend with than I ever before had in my Governess experience.
Mrs Scott & I never have got on well, be the fault where it may. One thing, she has not one feeling like a lady, altho' one ostensibly, & I cannot conscientiously approve of children having their own way in all things. It has been and is a very difficult situation to fill. I should long ere this have left it but the difficulty of obtaining another situation in this country is extreme and remuneration not adequate to the disadvantages! I tried in many quarters and made many an inquiry about another situation but to all my applications there was the invariable reply, any number of applicants on the same errand & no chance of their being supplied, nothing to be got.
Into the details of a Bush life I shall not enter much, its advantages & disadvantages. Of the former the principal is one does not spend too much money which is desirable as things are very dear in this Country. Of the latter the place feels like a prison to me, only without the ignominy. No books, no society, nothing improving. Everything retrograde - conversation, scandal & gossip, things I hate & have never been accustomed to. You may say perhaps I am overdrawing the picture because I am prejudiced against. Not so. I would not wilfully or willingly do it. It is the case.
Now I am quite determined to return home (I have saved sufficiently for the purpose) and want to ask you could you assist me in obtaining a situation in England, on my landing. I would rather have £25 there, than £100 here.  My own cannot help me. They find it quite enough to do to aid themselves. I must bear my own burdens, but it would be no burden were I out of this land. Can you, & if so will you, help me in this? I would not care how much I had to do, preferring an active life to my present desultory one.
I know all you would say of the overpopulation, & number of applicants for situations, but in extenuation for returning home my plea is I so dislike the Country & everything in connection with it I am satisfied I shall not regret taking a step homeward. I doubt if I am suited for the climate or people or an Australian life at all. I should very much like to be in or near London, having an intense admiration, if not love, for the Metropolis of the world.
I remain
Yours very sincerely
Rosa Payne
