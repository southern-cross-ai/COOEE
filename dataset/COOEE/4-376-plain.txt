I have given half as much again to a nigger and a stray hiding now and again thrown in gratis.  Out here on the fields I can save £10 a month and when I say save I mean I can put that much in the bank and have plenty of pocket money besides for clothes, boots, tobacco, etc. 
I am doing all right but cannot get settled down. My sole ambition is to make a place I can call home and I can assure you it is through no fault of mine that I haven't done so. I am trying to rent this place I spoke about with the right of purchase for £1900 when my lease is up by instalments of course and I think I could manage all right when I have the place in working order.
