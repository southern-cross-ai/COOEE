Debate resumed on resolutions proposed by Sir Henry Parkes (vide page 23).
Sir HENRY PARKES, in reply: 
In my first words, if I may venture without offending the sense of self-respect, I would offer my most unqualified congratulations to the distinguished men, some of whom have come from so great a distance to attend this Convention. I think I may fairly congratulate hon. gentlemen on the close adherence to purpose, the lucid statement, the absence of all collateral issues, and the sense of public duty which have characterised the speeches in this debate up to the present time. If there is any exception to that high rule of debate I know that what I have to say this morning will have nothing to do with it. I shall brush it away as I would a cobweb or any other offensive substance which obscured the light. We are not assembled here to bandy words about the site of the federal city; we are not here to prescribe a federal tariff; and we might just as well speak of determining the organisation of the federal army or of fixing its headquarters. We are here for one single object, which has been defined at every stage throughout our proceedings, and that object is to lend our assistance one to another, as best we may, to frame a scheme for the constitution of a federal government. I think that is the only object to which we can properly give our attention, and it gratifies me beyond measure that there has been such a consistent adherence to the consideration of it. I think the seven delegates from the youngest colony deserve our special attention. They have travelled a journey which would have deterred most persons from entering upon it even a score of years ago, and they came here at the earliest opportunity to assist us. I also think that the prime minister of that young colony, the Hon. John Forrest, deserves our special congratulations on the frank, manly speech be made to us, and the broad spirit of sympathy with our object which inspired that speech; and, I think, if I might go on without making some invidious distinction, that there are several other hon. gentlemen who specially have contributed valuable assistance to us in the debate which has taken place, a debate I venture to say which in its lofty character and its fruitful contribution to the end we have in view, must be gratifying as well as satisfying to every mind amongst us. Now, I am not going to travel far in a direction such as that I have ventured upon; but I will endeavour to deal with the object we have in view, in the light of the very instructive debate which we have so far had upon the subject. I was very sorry to hear one or two of the Western Australian delegates express a kind of reserved intention that their colony might not enter into this federation. I think something might be said for the sacrifices that must be made by the larger colonies as well as by the smaller; and I think it is right,  after what has been advanced on the part of others, that I should endeavour, in the fewest possible words, to state my view of the position which the colony of New South Wales occupies in this Convention, and in the prospect of the work which we are anxious to join in consummating. If by any chance, and I do not disguise from myself that there is that chance, the disaster should fall upon us of coming to no agreement, I, for one, feel that New South Wales can afford to stand alone as well as any colony of the group. Our position is this: At the close of last year we had a population of 1,170,000 souls, and, what is of much more importance, the elements of that population were of that character that our progressive increasers assured against that of any of the other colonies. For example, the percentage of our increase during the last twenty years was 30.15, as against the next highest, that of Victoria, 22.61. We then have a population which has proved itself full of resource, and which has the element of increase in a higher degree than that of any population of any other colony of this group. Last year we had a revenue of £9,063,397. In point of private wealth, probably the most subtle and the most convincing test of all of a nation's happiness, we stood ahead of all the colonies, and ahead of the civilised world. What I mean, so that there shall be no mistake, is that if the private wealth, which is considerably over £400,000,000, were distributed over every unit of the population, it would give us, if every person, including the person who has not £5 or 5s., had an equal distribution of this wealth, a higher degree of private wealth than that possessed by any other Australian colony, and a much higher degree of private wealth for the units of the population than that possessed by any nation in the wide world. Our private wealth would give to each inhabitant the sum of £366. Now, the next colony-that of Victoria-does not nearly approach that sum. If we go to the great nations of the world-and I will take three of them-the private wealth of the United Kingdom only gives £249 per inhabitant; the private wealth of France only gives £218 for every inhabitant; the private wealth of the United States only gives £240 for every inhabitant. Then we have still unalienated, and not even in the process of alienation, land amounting to 152,282,034 acres, and with that boundless wealth, which I state is the result of our civilised society, we have our vast mineral wealth, combining illimitable coal-mines, and illimitable mines of iron, and we have our other great resources, which I have not time to dwell upon, and, to crown all, we have only the responsibility of 700 miles of coast out of 8,500 miles. So that, if we do not come to any agreement, and we have each to pursue the path of separate nationhood, we have no fear of holding our own. I think it is quite right that I should state this much as to the position of New South Wales, because circumstances may arise which will render it impossible for New South Wales to enter into this federation. I, for one, as I have testified, am full of zeal for this federation; but I must remember that there are sacrifices which, if they cannot be made by a small population, certainly cannot be made by a large population. We cannot consent to be tied or linked inseparably to any body of states which manifest a selfish desire not to deal in an equitable and just spirit with the whole federation. Having said this much, and said it, I hope, in no mincing terms, I trust I shall not be misunderstood as lacking in any degree in zeal to bring about this federation; but, for it to be entered upon-and it cannot be entered upon except with the free consent of the free people of these colonies-for it to be entered upon with any prospect of success, the people of  the large colonies as well as the small must be secured in their inalienable rights. Now, I am tempted, at the risk of possibly being accused of performing an unnecessary task to ask what really is government? Government, I apprehend, on any just, honest, not to say any philosophical basis, is a contrivance which is found necessary in, a community of men to protect their rights, and property, and their liberty, to enforce their laws, and to repress crime; and whatever form this government assumes, the true principle is to call upon the people for whom this government is necessary, in the form of taxation, for just such sacrifices as may be necessary to support it. I am one of those who hold it to be a fundamental wrong to impose burdens upon a free people for any purpose whatever than the purpose of sustaining necessary institutions under a settled government; and in that case the taxes should be raised in the manner most consistent with liberty, the manner which will least interfere with the free actions of the citizens, and the manner which will be least oppressive as a pecuniary burden. Now, in these colonies we have, to all intents and purposes, the institutions of government as perfect as in any part of the world. I do not admit that the government of England is more perfect than ours, or that it works more to the advantage of the people. I certainly do not admit that the government of the American states is more perfect than ours, or that it works more to the advantage of the people of that great commonwealth; and, certainly, I cannot admit that the government of any European state is more perfect than ours. If, then, we wanted merely government, we have it in a form corresponding with that with which we have grown up from the cradle, which we have learnt to venerate, and which has worked efficiently and well for the good of every section of our population. Why, then, it may be asked by some, but not by many, I should think, do we seek to create another government? I shall endeavour in a few words to answer the question I put. We seek to create another government, because we have arrived at a time when we have found by many telling circumstances that these separate governments, however efficient and satisfactory they may be in working out the internal affairs of the respective colonies, are not adequate for the larger duties which now devolve upon us as an Australian people. I will endeavour to point out how it is that these governments cannot work out the destiny of Australia from the point at which she has arrived by her own enterprise, her own foresight, her own industry, and her own never-failing energies. There are a number of things which no one of the separate governments can by any possibility do, and those things are amongst the highest objects of government. The separate governments cannot by any possibility efficiently conduct the defence of these Australian colonies. It is no use for me to attempt to argue this subject, because I apprehend that gentlemen around me will readily admit it. The ground has been gone over frequently. It has been gone over by men possessing an intimate knowledge of the subject, and a very forcible and lucid power in explaining that knowledge; but I may be pardoned the assertion that it is simply impossible for the defence
Mr. FYSH: 
No point was made of it!
Mr. GILLIES: 
Certainly; by several speakers!
Sir THOMAS McILWRAITH: 
Nobody made a point of it!
Sir HENRY PARKES: 
I am willing to defer to my hon. friend in almost everything; but, perhaps, he will allow me to judge how far it was made a point, find how far it was not. The point I meant is the contention that ministers should be so selected, and, as I understand it, that provision should be made by law, that they should be taken from each of the colonies. That is utterly inconsistent with parliamentary government as we know it. Now, what has been the course in later times, in the best times of English history, in the formation of a ministry? The Queen, or in a colony, the Queen's representative, sends for a person to form a ministry. Whom does she send for? The Sovereign sends forth the person who, by his standing in political life, by his experience, by his character, by the degree in which he is trusted by his political friends, and by his proved capacity, is most likely to secure a body of capable men to serve the Crown. He having accepted this task is absolutely free to make what choice he likes, and naturally he chooses the men whom experience has taught him are most likely to assist him in a capable administration of affairs. If he were compelled to take three, four, or five colleagues of whom he had no knowledge, I can only say that no man of high spirit and clear discernment of his duties would accept the office. It would be impossible. How could the administration of affairs be conducted under our form of government unless it was conducted by men who each in the other had the completest confidence? I am quite sure that no single man amongst the high minded men who are the leaders of the English nation would undertake the formation of a ministry subject to any restriction of that kind imposed by law, usage, or otherwise. It would be simply impracticable. Then as to the government being responsible to both houses, suppose this state of things arose: that the senate passed a resolution of want of confidence, and suppose the house of representatives met it by a vote of confidence, how then is that government to be responsible? I think that the more we depart from the broad lines of the English Constitution, developed as it has been during the reign of the present Sovereign, the more certain we are to fall into sloughs of despond-into many dangers. With regard to the construction of this senate, it, is proposed, even in these resolutions, to give to the colony of Western Australia, with its 45,000 people, the same representation that is given to New South Wales with its 1,200,000. Surely that is a vast concession, and that is given entirely in order to harmonise those incongruities which are admitted, which are admitted with sympathy, but which must exist until the progress of time, and the progress of the colony, may emancipate that particular colony from that region of incongruity. I should not object to meeting the smaller colonies, especially Western Australia, by giving her for a time larger representation in the house of representatives; but that must be limited. There must be a time when her growth will render it unnecessary. But prepared as I am, as far as I can, to make some anomaly in the constitution we are about to construct, merely to meet the case of Western Australia-anxious as I am, and anxious as I believe my colleagues all are, to have the young colony amongst us-if she cannot see her way to join us without calling on us to make sacrifices inconsistent with our clear duty, unhappy as it may be felt, it would be best for her to wait for a time to enter the federation. But I trust we shall not come to that. I trust some concession may be made quite consistent with our adherence to the principles which ought to pervade our work by which she can join is. I am aware that outside these walls, at any rate, there is a feeling that we ought to wait; that the time has not yet come. I can only repeat what I have said in other places, and what I have uniformly said, that if we are not ripe for federation now it is incumbent upon those who tell us so to name the hour and day when we shall be ripe. If we miss this particular opportunity, every year that rolls over us will make the difficulties greater; if we miss this opportunity, every experience that is before us "Will abundantly prove that we have not risen to a just sense of the magnitude of our duties. These difficulties which our separate existence have imposed will go on increasing. They can only have one crop of fruit; they can only produce antipathy, disunion, aggression, reprisal, widespread discontent, and, if they are suffered to go on, civil war. That is a prospect which no man of just mind can contemplate-that these colonies, sprung from the same stock, possessing the same great inheritance of equal laws and all the riches of science which have been achieved and stored up for us in the mother country-that we, side by side, instead of living in brotherhood and amity, should live in constant irritation and hostility. Either we must join hands, or we must hold out our hands in defiance of each other. In the very nature of things, we cannot be divided and be one. In the very nature of things, we cannot submit to causes of irritation, causes of infliction, causes of dissatisfaction, causes of exasperation, and still live in brotherhood. It is only by joining hands in good faith as the people of one kindred; it is only by giving and taking, by entertaining compromise as far as compromise can be entertained without deadly injury to principle-it is only by doing that we can hope to found this union. If the gentlemen around me are actuated by in earnest desire to effect this union it will be effected. If we unfortunately miss this great occasion and leave the work undone, it will be done in a few years hence, not many years, and it will be done by younger hands, who will gain the great credit of having effected this bond of union, which will be in itself, if rightly effected, of more value than any other achievement in the history of this continent. I would ask hon. gentlemen when we go into Committee not to dwell much upon these resolutions. They are not worth it. They were submitted, as gentlemen will recollect, in order to raise that most instructive debate which we have listened to. They have answered their purpose, and that debate, I venture to predict, will form a notable passage in the history of Australia; and whatever becomes of the present immediate movement, this debate will have effect upon the cause of federation until it is consummated. But I would suggest that the wisest practical course for us to take will be as soon as possible to agree upon what may be called the vital provisions of this bill-that is, the provision as to the construction of the federal parliament, the provision as to the construction of the federal executive, the provision as to the representation of the smaller states, and such other provisions as involve the rigid  difficulties between the different delegates. If we can once agree to these provisions it appears to me that a committee of such men as we have amongst us could frame a machinery to give harmonious effect to them in four-and-twenty hours, and our work would be done. But I would suggest as a practical aim that we try in open convention to agree upon those which I will call the vital provisions of this bill. I have no time-and I do not think it is very fitting that I should indulge in anything of the sort-I have no time to talk of this question of republicanism which has been so ungraciously launched amongst us. I want to know where, in all history, you will find any instance where a people have revolted and chosen a new form of government when they were contented with the old form?
Mr. MUNRO: 
And had no grievance!
Sir HENRY PARKES: 
The very parent of the erection of new governments is some cause of grievance, which everybody feels. We feel none so far as the home Government is concerned. And have we such encouraging examples in the republican forms of government in different parts of the world that we should be seduced from that of our own, which has stood the shocks of revolution and the social earthquakes of the last fifty years and never been shaken? Why, so beloved is our Sovereign in that great offshoot of the English nation, the United States, that I venture to say if Queen Victoria, by any possibility, could visit the United States, she would receive a grander and more enthusiastic reception than ever was awarded to man or woman before. I venture to say that amongst the potentates of the world, including their own President, there is none more widely respected, more widely revered by all the best minds of the great American commonwealth than the beloved Queen under whom we live. I go further than that. I contend that the woman who sits on the English throne, stripped of all her royal robes and all her royal pendants, is no common woman in the administration of affairs; that she has disclosed a genius for government, a close attention to business, and a keen foresight which have never been equalled by any monarch known to history; and that she has, above all thing, disclosed all amazing insight in her dealings with every constitutional difficulty that has arisen. Beyond this, if we even dwell for a moment on the expenses of monarchy, they are nothing to the waste of wealth in every presidential election in the United States. The wealth withdrawn from the ordinary channels of trade and commerce, and withdrawn from private fortune in every great contention for the presidential chair, far exceeds any extravagance that may be supposed to exist in supporting the monarchy of England. But I hold this as a principle in human affairs, that no well regulated mind, no mind that rises to the exigencies of any occasion when that occasion presents itself, will ever anticipate what is in the far future. If a time should come when it would be necessary to sever the connection with the mother country it will come as it came in America, in spite of the loyalty, in spite of the good feeling of the chief men of the time. It will not come to meet the wild ravings of some person who may call out "republicanism," without the slightest knowledge of what he is talking about. Sufficient for the day is the government thereof. We have a government of which we ought to be proud, and it is neither the part of loyalty, nor is it yet the part of common-sense to be anticipating something which may come in the dim future when all our attention is occupied-necessarily occupied-with that which we posses, and that with which we are satisfied. I would ask the hon. gentlemen, who have, at such great sacrifices, come here, to endeavour, to take the course which shall  be as free as possible from all collateral issues. This is no time for glowing periods; it is no time for rhetorical flights; but it is a time for hard and steady work in trying to do what we are called here to do, and I would ask hon. members to do their utmost, by a calm self-suppression, by a close attention to the object which has brought us here, by mutual respect, mutual forbearance, and a disposition to compromise where compromise is possible, to assist each other in bringing about this great work; and I would say that if we seize the occasion and succeed in doing the work we shall have, not now so vividly as hereafter, the blessings of this and succeeding generations on what we have accomplished. I now beg to move:
That the Convention resolve itself into Committee of the Whole to 
consider the resolutions in detail.
Question resolved in the affirmative.
