Dear Frank 
I Know you will be much surprised at not my writing home, but to be Candid thare is no employment in Melbourne, that is the Cause which detained me. - William O'Dwyer Came to the Cuzco and brought me to his place, he has a splendid hotel. I Can never forget his Kindness to me and his good wife, as nice and as affectionate a woman as I ever meet. He has a good Situation at the draipery in one of the first houses in the City - I Saw Anthony O'Lughlin he received me most affectionaly, he has a good Situation and most steady. 
I Came to Australia at an age not Suitable to the Climate, a strange land and a strange people. I never Could live here, in fact it is impossible to Get a Job here. I am writing this note at F. Hennessys - he is one of my best friends. I Saw a Great number from Ennistimon and every one of them treated me with the greatest affection.  I long to be home again. Send me the Clare Examiner and write me a long Etter. 
Blive me from your fond 
Brother Edward to Mr Francis Comber
