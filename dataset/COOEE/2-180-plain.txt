The party in question, set out au cheval well armed and provisioned, taking led horses, were out twenty-four days, and guided by the Major's map, reached Australia Felix. They describe the herbage as plentiful and most luxuriant; the water however in less abundance than was expected, but that can be accounted for by the long succession of drought since Major Mitchell's discovery. They found the blacks numerous and troublesome, and returned after having travelled over five hundred miles.
