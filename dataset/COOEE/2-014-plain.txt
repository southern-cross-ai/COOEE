SYDNEY, Monday, October 30, 1826
On Friday morning last, long ere "the early village cock had once done salutation to the morn," the road to Parramatta resounded with "cheerful note of preparation," all was bustle and activity among those vulgarly called the fancy, who had previously made grand requisition upon all the depots for horse flesh of the second quality.
The parties hied to a certain delectable spot two miles short of Parramatta where the intrinsic merit of sterling and currency blood was about to be decided. - For the honour of Old England on the one hand, and the fame of Australia's Sons on the other; there were few among the lovers of the barbarous and vicious sport who did not feel a high degree of interest.
A lively sensation had been excited for several weeks past from the known courage and science of both pugilists. George Glew, the English champion, was backed for Â£50 to contest the palm of victory with Young Kable, the Currency youth, by some of the higher orders of the sporting world and heavy bets were depending on the result of the battle.
About nine o'clock, the combatants entered a roped ring, and stripped in excellent style, the coolness and intrepidity which characterizes an Englishman, was never more conspicuously displayed. Betting was 6 to 4 on Glew, notwithstanding the gigantic stature of Kable, who was a mountain of a man, when compared with his antagonist.
Twenty-five rounds were fought, when an accident decided not the superiority of man, but the fate of the battle. A fall on the ropes by which his neck was injured, rendered Glew incapable of coming up to time. Kable was dreadfully disfigured. His oponent on the contrary looked a little worse, offering to fight him again next day. It was a dreadful battle and it is since reported that Kable is either dead, or about to die.
It will be remembered that Young Kable came into prominence, when he defeated Clark, the celebrated English pugilist, on February 20, 1824. To the astonishment of all and to the confusion of many hundreds assembled to witness the delightful spectacle, Kable beat his much dreaded antagonist in about ten minutes, to the great glee of all the Currency lads.
We are sorry thus to have to recount the introduction into this colony of this abominable mode of displaying mere natural brutal courage. We like to see, and to hear of, the prosperity of the Australian race, with whose interests and welfare much of our happiness is connected; but we must confess it is neither congenial to our disposition, accordant with the principles of morality, nor honorable to them, to pride themselves on boxing, or any European accomplishment. 
If certain men, who come to this Colony, must continue at their old practices, let them horde with one another, and glut in each other's blood; but not have for their associates AUSTRALIA'S ONLY HOPE - HER GROWING YOUTH! With equal propriety might one join in a robbery with such characters, as enter the pugilistic lists.
