You can see by the already mentioned that we have got cold weather here as well as at home but the atmosphere is much clearer. I would rather not give any advice to William further than what I have done as there is a second party interested in the matter viz. Sarah and that is my reason for not advising him for or against. If I did it would simply be a repetition of what I have already told him in a former letter. If he came out here or any other person they have to run the risk of getting a situation to suit them. Some are very fortunate and others are not, but a man or woman that is willing to take a turn at anything for a time has never any reason to cry want. Although times are dull here at present, yet there is always work for a man with a willing mind. But men of capital have a better chance here than a man that is depending on his work graft. 
I believe if we had enough money to give us a start in a store up country that we could do well yet I have no reason to grumble and I may here mention that I don't regret coming out as regards money matters. Of course the mind often wanders back to the old home and home has always its tighes.
