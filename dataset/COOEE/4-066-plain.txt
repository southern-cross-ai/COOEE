You know it looks careless not to write from these places where the ship calls at. And I felt it greatly when it was read out in my hearing that we did not write. There were none of whole party who wrote more than us. You must not be saying anything I said, to any of the neighbours. You know it might go to Watson's or Sheil's and then come back here and if it does I will promise you that all the news you get will be little from me. Remember that.
