How they divide the watches I do not know; but Sure I am that if they were up altogether during the whole of time night they would not be sufficient to guard against the depredations so constantly committed; it is easy for the house breaker to watch them off' their beat and effect his deeds of darkness, as for me to peal and eat a roasted potato.
