 I hope and speak the sentiments of the others when I say we hope that you look on yesterday a year ago and yesterday 4 years ago with joy and not with sorrow. We ask you all to rejoice to know that we are spared to prosper in the land of our adoption notwithstanding the little difficulties we have had to contend with. We feel thankful that our position is improved although the home tithes binds us to friends much dearer than any in this side of the globe.
