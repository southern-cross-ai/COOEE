 you will wonder when you get this why I left the station so soon. I would not have left so soon had the food been good enough to afford healthful nourishment. The first seven or eight weeks the food was pretty good as I got plenty of milk for my tea and sometimes a bit of rice pudding for dinner but the two cows which we had on the out station went dry consequently there was no milk to be had and all my meals consisted of bread and salt meat and tea without milk. I would have put up with it for a bit had I not got a cold which started my cough so Hugh wrote for me to come down to Melbourne and I did so and got here yesterday morning and was quite long enough on the station. Hugh was greatly uplifted when he saw that I looked so well for he was very uneasy when he knew of me getting cold. Hugh Sheils was telling me yesterday that there was never a bit of life in him when I was away and whenever he heard of my coming back his spirits rose and he got quite cheery. I was quite long enough on the station  all I got for 15 weeks work was Â£8 so my trip to Queensland was pretty dear. It cost more than twice as much to take me there and bring me back again so you see I have not made a pile yet but I hope my fortune will change by and by.
