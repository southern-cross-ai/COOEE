 the gardener here is a new chum who has been out in the colony about the same time as myself. He understands the management of bees and he a I have determined to start a small bee farm in spring. It will be carried on a more scientific principle than I used to see you do it at home. There will be no destroying of bees for their honey. We will take the honey when they are at work extract the honey from the combs and then place them back in the hive to be refilled. The hive consists of a square box which can be opened at the top. There are a number of square frames which are hung a little apart parallel to each other. In these the bees builds their comb and they can removed when filled or at will without very much disturbing the bees.
