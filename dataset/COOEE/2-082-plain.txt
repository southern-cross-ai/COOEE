There are a few Blacks here, but I find it very difficult to raise their attention to listen to anything concerning religion, so as to make any impression upon them. They hear what is said to them, but make no farther inquiry; nor do I suppose that they think about what is said to them any longer than just for the moment.
Friday, 4, January.
A large party of Blacks came this morning to Wellington. Their chief design appeared to be to get something to eat; for after dinner they all went off again. I had a conversation with several of them, and asked them various questions about the things around me, in order to inform their minds of the Author of all, and to distinguish those to them which had been made by art by white people. One, who had a pipe asked me simply, whether God had made it. I was much pleased with this question, as it afforded me opportunity and encouragement to say something more on the subject; for it is not often that they ask such questions. Praise be unto God through our Lord Jesus Christ, for having sustained me hitherto, and for every little encouragement he has given to me with regard to the Blacks. May the happy time soon arrive, when they shall worship in the courts of Jehovah, and sing praises unto the Lamb.
Good Friday,5, April.
Had divine service which was tolerably well attended. The Blacks are as indifferent to spiritual things as they were before. Every thing we can say to them, seems to have but a momentary effect.
Sunday, 7, April.
Easterday. Had divine service, a good number attended. There are very few Blacks here at present.
Sunday, 14, April.
A few Blacks came this afternoon, but they soon went away again. I am a little discouraged with regard to them; but we must persevere till it pleases the Lord to produce a change in their disposition by the power of his Holy Spirit.
Monday, 15, April.
Intended to go into the country among the Blacks, but having been informed that the horse was required at home, I was obliged to relinquish my design. I went therefore to Cobolyen only where I met with a few Blacks, with whom I sat down and talked, learning at the same time a few words from them.
Wednesday, 17, April.
Went with Mrs Handt and Mrs Watson to Cobolyen. I found some Blacks there who had not been frequently in these parts.
Thursday, 18, April. 
There are now several Blacks here, a few of whom came from Cobolyen to-day. It is a great hindrance not to be able to speak freely to them in their own language but I hope these mountains of difficulties will be gradually moved, so that they will hear in their own tongue "the wonderful works of God", wrought in the redemption of mankind through his only begotten Son.
Sunday, 21, April.
The services as usual, were regularly performed. A blind black man called Boby came this evening to us with his family in order to stay for a while. The Blacks have been more numerous last week than usual, and I hope that the time will soon arrive when they will receive instruction and believe the blessed Gospel of the Saviour.
Tuesday, 23, April.
The black man who came here with his family last Sunday seems to be superior to his countrymen in intellect. He asked me more questions about God and religion than all the Blacks have done with whom I ever conversed. O may the Lord begin his work of grace in this poor man's heart. Received a letter this day from one of my Christian friends in Sydney, which greatly refreshed my mind.
Thursday, 25, April.
Conversed with the black man Boby. He asked me, whether God lived in a house in heaven, and whether he did eat bread. I endeavoured to give him a short description of God as far as I was able in his own language. He asked me also, whether God had made "War-gan" (large canoe or boat.) I told him that white men made it, but that God made the trees grow, which they cut down for that purpose. The idea of a large canoe he had probably received from white men, or from a boat which was formerly on the Settlement previous to the losing of his eye-sight. Their own canoes, called Gum-bi-lan, consist of a mere sheet of bark tied together on both ends with a string so that the ends are above the water.
Friday, 26, April. 
The black man Wesley, mentioned under date the 26th of March, has been treacherously speared by one of his countrymen, and has since died in consequence of the wound.
Sunday, 28, April.
The wife of the black man who came here last Sunday was found last night in the bush about to kill the child she had just brought forth. She had already given it a kick, with her foot, and thrust it towards the fire, so that its back was burnt by it. Just before her delivery she had gone a short distance into the bush in order to be unnoticed, that she might conceal her atrocious act. It is a halfcast child, and that was probably the chief reason why she intended to kill it. I spoke this morning with the blind husband and reproved him for having prostituted his wife. He replied that white men should know that it was wrong, and not have asked her of him as they know about God etc. A just reply indeed. They who should endeavour to teach them good things, render them by their conduct and conversation worse than they were before. O how long shall the name of our Lord be thus profaned by those who bear it!
Wednesday, 1, May. 
A young black man came today, one of the most intelligent I ever have seen among them. He gave satisfactory answers to the questions I put to him (considering their incomparable degraded state;) and made several inquiries, which they do, in general, but seldom. We should like him to have stayed with us, but he went back again with the white man he had accompanied here, who had come on some business. If they could be persuaded to stay at one place there would be more hope of doing good among them, but their wandering and roving disposition, and their indifference to the comforts of a civilised life, is the great barrier in the way of their improvement. Nor are they prevented by a want of food from so doing, for this they can procure every where.
Saturday, 4, May.
An old black man called Billy came fighting today with another Black, and had his left leg speared through. The other had killed his dog yesterday, which gave rise to the quarrel. The blind man is yet here with his family, and I find him profitable to me with regard to the language.
Friday, 10, May.
Have conversed with the Blacks several times about God and their future state. May the gracious Saviour bless and own my feeble endeavours. The blind man Boby went away to-day with his wife but will soon return.
Monday, 13, May.
This morning at 8 o'clock my wife was safely delivered of a son. We had felt some anxiety respecting this event, as we are so far from medical help in cases of this kind. But our God has been gracious to us in hearing our prayers and preserving both the root and the branch. Praise to his name! May our dear boy be a child of God, and an heir of glory! Whether he lives or dies, may he be the Lord's.
Monday, 27, May. 
Some Blacks brought us the intelligence to-day that the black man who killed Wesley, mentioned under date April the 26th, has been killed in return by some of the deceased's friends. We learnt however afterwards, that they had not been able to accomplish their design, that man being so strong for them. Should they succeed in putting their design into execution, this act would probably occasion more mischief, as it would enrage the friends of this person, so that there might be no end of retaliating. May they soon be taught divine grace to obey the excellent precept of the Gospel, not to render evil for evil. Mrs Handt has been unwell for the last fortnight from taking cold soon after her confinement, and has consequently required much attention and care. The child also has been ill.
Wednesday, 29, May.
Some of the Blacks came to-day, most of whom were infected with the venereal disorder. They are certainly most pitiful objects both with regard to their temporal and eternal condition. Here they lay around their little fires in the open air exposed to cold and wet; and frequently too lazy to get up and fetch their victuals, when already prepared for them. As to what regards their souls, they are in reality as dry bones.
Friday, 31, May.
Three of the Blacks who are sometimes staying here for a few days had been hunting today and returned with two Oppossums, which served for their supper.
Sunday, June 2, May. 
A rainy day. Very few persons attended divine service.
Monday, 10, May.
There have not been many Blacks here of late, and their numbers altogether appear but small.
Friday, 14, May.
When I was in the garden to-day, two Blacks came up to me, one called Billy Sixfoot and another whose name is Neddy. The latter asked me for a turnip, which, when received, he gave to his comrade, and then asked another for himself. In complying with his requests, I tried to direct their minds to Him who causes the turnips to grow.
Saturday, 15, May. 
Was sawing some wood to-day, and as I, at length, found it too fatiguing, I requested two Blacks, who had come this morning to Wellington to assist me; but neither of them would do so, as they were too idle, and as they had just before received plenty of meat. Food is their only inducement to do anything, and on that account they remained unmoved by all my persuasions.
Monday, 17, May. 
Succeeded to-day in getting one of the Blacks to assist me in sawing wood, in return of which I gave him some bread and meat. If they could be induced to stay, and to do every day a little work; a great point would by this means be gained, as it would afford us more opportunity to instruct them. But as this is not the case, we labour under many disadvantages, and must confine ourselves to speak with them about God, just as we every now and then meet with them; when their minds are apparently not at all in a proper state to receive any impression. May God hear our prayer for them in opening their hearts to receive the truth of the Gospel.
Sunday, 23, May.
One of the black girls who are staying here when standing near the fire this morning, met with a dreadful accident. Her clothes suddenly took fire, and very soon was all in a blaze. Nobody was with her at the moment, but some children, who were frightened, and could render her no assistance. She, struck with terror, ran out of doors, where by reason of the wind the fire became more dreadful; and before she received assistance, her back, shoulders and several other parts of her body were severely burned. She is now in exquisite pain.
Sunday, 30, May.
The girl who burnt herself last Sunday has been very bad, but is more in a state of recovery. The Blacks are according to all appearance very few in number. I have never seen more together than about 50. The females are particularly few compared with the men. The cause of their being so small in number may be chiefly ascribed to their barbarous practice of destroying not very unfrequently their offspring. Of late it was reported, that a mother had killed her new-born infant in the bush. First she had broken its neck, and then burnt it. This is horrid and unnatural. It is however but too true that they not unfrequently commit such atrocities. They stand indeed in great need of a Saviour to deliver them from their barbarity as well as from their wretchedness, both temporal and spiritual. And we want new courage and strength; for as yet there has been very little appearance of their paying attention to what they hear, or of inducing them to practice the rudiments of civilisation. May the Lord change them in their disposition, inclinations and habits, otherwise nothing good can be done to them; for vain is the help of man. 
My occupations have been during the last quarter from July to October 1833 as follows:
Collecting words and sentences from the Natives as opportunity afforded.
Copying the whole of those words and sentences which I had already obtained, and frequently reading them all over, in order to impress them upon my mind.
Talking on religious subjects with the Natives when I could meet with any.
Working every now and then in the garden to raise some vegetables.
Composing a sermon for every alternate Sunday.
Reading sometimes a little Greek and Hebrew, in order to refresh my memory, or some other books to assist me in the English language.
At intervals engaged in doing little jobs necessary to be done in and about the house etc

July, 4.
Many of the Blacks have left these parts at present, and gone in search of the "mial" (strange) Black, mentioned under date May 27 who killed Wesley, in order to kill him in return. May divine grace soon enable and teach them, not to avenge themselves, but to render good from evil.
Monday, 8.
A neighbouring tribe of Blacks was said this morning to be coming up to Wellington, which circumstance occasioned great fear among the Blacks here, especially as it was said that they came on purpose to kill one of them who is indeed a very bad man. They had been seen by the Wellington Blacks about 3 or 4 miles from here. Br. Watson and I took a ride in the afternoon to see them, accompanied by the son of the black man whom they were said to intend to kill, and another Black. But when we came to Tea-pot-pinch, about 9 miles from here, where they met some other Blacks of their own tribe, they desisted from going any farther, for fear of being killed. When they had shewed us the direction, we had to take to pursue our way, we left them. One of them however, the son of the intended object of revenge, took courage afterwards, as it proved, for he soon followed us. We rode on then towards the place, where the strange Blacks were supposed to sit down, but could not discover any trace of them, and had to return towards evening without having obtained the object in view.
Wednesday, 10.
There are more Blacks here than usual. Some of them were curious to see our little boy. Mr Betts from Parramatta, Son in law to the Rev. S. Marsden, paid us a visit today. Went with him to the cave, where we found the air, being winter here at present, very warm. Besides the curiosities mentioned under date the 19th of Nov. 1832, we discovered many bats sticking to the rocks, which had taken their shelter in the cave from the cold.
Wednesday, 17.
Succeeded in obtaining one of the Blacks to assist me in fetching some wood out of the bush, and carrying it to the garden, where I am building a Shed to keep tools in etc. It has been very dry weather of late. The seeds of the vegetables in the ground cannot well come up on that account; and those vegetables which are out are hindered in their growth. But I hope the Lord will soon send a gracious and refreshing rain for the benefit both of man and beast.
Friday, 19.
The white men on the various stock stations up and down the country cause the Blacks to be worse than they formerly were, as they teach them to swear and to curse etc. They prove a great hindrance to Missionary work; although this should not discourage us as the Blacks are the more to pitied on that account, and have a greater claim to be instructed in better things. Have they received the evil things, and should they not partake of the good things? Spoke to day with some of them about the Saviour, that he died for them etc. but I cannot say what impression it made upon them; for they kept silence, neither making any inquiry, nor giving an answer.
Sunday, 28.
Had divine service. Several of the Blacks attended. May the time soon arrive when they shall attend the divine ordinances with devotion.
Saturday, August 3.
A black man, very ill, is staying here in order that he may have some medical assistance. He is called "Coborn" (great) Billy, and has three wives, two of them are also sick. They are indeed a very wretched family, and the cause of their disease proves that they are more so with regard to their souls than their bodies.
Sunday, 4.
Another Sabbath is ended. The duties and services of the day have been performed in the usual manner. Went in the afternoon to see the family of the Blacks above mentioned. The man sat by a small fire boiling a handful of wheat in a pot. Two of his wives lay almost buried in dust and ashes, one of them was embracing and kissing a half-starved dog, and the other was asleep. The third, an elderly woman, had two interesting little boys sitting beside her. She and her children are not sick, but as dirty as the rest. More pitiable objects than this diseased and filthy family, were perhaps scarcely ever beheld. May he whose bowels melt with tenderness, and who alone can relieve them, speedily appear for their help.
Wednesday, 14.
A black man, called Coborn Neddy, came to-day for medical assistance, being much diseased of their usual abominable disorder. To be cured of this malady is an inducement for them to come here. But as soon as they are returned to health, and even frequently before they have recovered, they creep into the bush again, and turn to their former habits, as the dog to his own vomit.
Thursday, 15.
Coborn Neddy, who came yesterday, went away again. This is their manner. They come to be cured, but seldom wait till this effected, their patience being very soon exhausted.
Wednesday, 21.
Took some cabbage to Coborn Billy and his three wives, and at the same time endeavoured to converse with them about religion and the Saviour; but as far as I could judge they paid no serious attention to it. The cabbage they eat raw, being too idle to dress it.
Saturday, 24.
A large party of the Blacks came here this morning, both men and women. Their design for visiting us was to get some blankets. I talked to them about God and Jesus Christ. upon which they asked me for some bread, though they had already received a quantity of meat for their dinner. They seldom boil this meat, but throw it on the fire and roast it a little, except they receive some salt meat from white people, and have a pot lent to them. They have no property, nor do they care about it. Their whole riches consist in a short cloak made of oppossum skins, sewed together so as to form nearly a square. Not every one however is possessed of one, and if they can get a blanket, they are sure not to trouble themselves so far as to make an oppossum skin cloak, though they might easily do it, considering the many oppossums they kill. Besides this cloak they have some spears, womeras and clubs. If one has a wife, she is generally obliged to carry these weapons, at least some of them. The wealth of the female sex is a cloak of the same description, or a blanket, a stick, which they use to dig up roots for their sustenance, and generally a drinking vessel, the excrescence of a tree, prepared for that purpose, about the size of a man's head. Besides these things, they carry a little bag on their backs in which they have some trifles, perhaps some remaining food and some pipe clay, with which the men paint themselves when they have a "Corobera" (dance). Both sexes generally wear a headband, and the males wear also a girdle, from which hangs down in the front and behind a small bunch of various strips of the skin of the oppossum.
Monday, 26.
Spoke with the Blacks about religion; they made one inquiry only, and I could not discover that my conversation made any serious impression upon their minds. We must sow weeping, and leave the event to the Lord, who may perhaps grant a joyful harvest, though we may not be permitted to see it.
Tuesday, 27.
Took a ride to a Stockstation, to see a white man, who was said to retain a blacks man's wife, who had been (as the common expression is) lent to him. He denied that he had kept her back; but said he had sent her away a few days ago, and told her, not to come near his hut any more because she had endeavoured to take his cloak. I spoke very seriously to him about his soul and his conduct, as he is a notoriously wicked character. He confessed that he was a wicked man, and seemed to be a little moved. I did however not give much credit to his sincerity of being sorry about his conduct, for there is a great deal of duplicity in him. Notwithstanding as he expressed a desire to have a New Testament, and I happened to have one in my pocket, I thought it my duty to part with it.
Saturday, 31.
Have been talking several times with the Blacks, and I trust that the Lord will cause our conversations with them to produce a good effect. But alas they are apparently insensible and indifferent with regard to spiritual things. Reflection and gratitude do not seem to enter their minds. With regard to sympathy they are far from it. To see them, and to witness their habits and conduct, indeed is quite sufficient to sink one's heart. But however degraded, however wretched, however equal to the brute beasts they are in many respects, it is not impossible for the Almighty to change them. May he do so speedily.
Monday, September 2.
Went to see Coborn Billy, mentioned under the 21st of last month. As he was sick and seemingly in want of food, I returned and brought him some meat. When he was eating one of his wives, who had been seeking grass roots for food, returned from the bush. She was extremely weak and sickly, and as it appeared almost starved. The reason of their privation is because they are too lazy to grind wheat for themselves. I told him he should give her some of the meat, which he did in a reluctant manner. They are unfeeling even towards their nearest relation, and envy each other of a mouthful of food. If this women had been his favourite wife, he might perhaps have given her willingly some of his meat, but unhappily she did not happen to be the person. I saw him however sitting with some other Blacks a few days ago, and feasting with them on a warm cake, baked in the coals, while his three wives were sitting hungry at a distance, not having received a bit of it. And when I asked him and his comrades, why they did not give any to those poor women, who had no food at all, he, as well as the others laughed at me. That was all the sympathy showed by them. May divine grace teach and incline them to do to their neighbours as they wish that they should behave towards them.
Thursday, 5.
Have been several times conversing with the Blacks, wishing to impart to them some knowledge of divine things and to make at the same time some progress in the language. But they like better to hear about "patter" (food) than anything else; and are constantly complaining that they are hungry. The oppossums, which they are catching at this time, are generally very young. They have, as far as I have seen, one or two, which they carry in a bag with which providence has furnished them. In this bag there are also the teats, which are sucked by their young. It is singular to see the little creatures moving in the bag after the mother is dead; and to see them creep in again, when they have been taken out, seemingly unconscious of their parents death.
Friday, 6.
Spoke to Coborn Billy, who is yet sick, and told him to pray God to make him better; for he could do so; but if God did not restore him, he would never be well again.
Saturday, 7.
When speaking with the Blacks to day, I was asked for some bread. I replied that we had very little of it at present. Upon which they said that they supposed when the wheat was ripe we should have plenty to give them. I answered, we should, but that they should pray God to make the wheat grow, that we might have a plentiful harvest.
Monday, 9.
Spoke with a black woman, called Poll. When I asked her, who made her, she replied, 'A black man'. From this answer I took occasion to tell her more about God. I received this answer several times when asking them this question but I refrained from mentioning it.
Wednesday, 11.
When conversing with a black man, he asked me whether God was a "Diribany" (old man). May the Lord enlighten his mind to a further inquiry about these things.
Thursday, 12.
Last evening Colonel Despard and two Officers arrived here on a visit. The Col. accepted of a lodging at the Mission house. He was very agreeable in his conversation and appeared well inclined towards religion.
Saturday, 14.
The Blacks, who were staying here, suddenly took their departure this afternoon, as they intend to have a grand Corobera. On these occasions, remonstrances are of no avail, and those who before appeared almost civilised, will go with the party and unite with them in all their heathenish customs, with great avidity.
Sunday, 15.
A melancholy accident happened not far from here last week. A little black boy, called Wellington, was sitting upon the top of a loaded dray, which unexpectedly upset and crushed him to death.
Monday, 30
A few Blacks, who had been frequently here before returned to day from the place where they had been to Corobera. Thus their wandering disposition often brings them here; and though they will not remain here, they never, I believe, go away again without hearing something of religion. May God over-rule this evil for their everlasting good and his glory.
Thursday, 3
Have been talking to the Blacks, as opportunity afforded itself; and my prayer is that it may be for their spiritual benefit. A year of our being here is ended. We have not been able to give flourishing accounts of the success of our labour; but not withstanding, we have great cause for thankfulness to God for all the mercies enjoyed, and for having been supported and preserved thus far. We have been sowing in tears, may we ere long reap in joy!
October, 4.
Conversed with a young black man called Tommy, who has several times done some little jobs for me. I asked why he did not stop here always, and work a little every day that he might have his victuals regularly and live like white men. He replied that black men were accustomed to walk in the bush but confessed that it was not so good a mode of living as that of white people. This man, when here at Wellington, is sometimes induced to work a little, in order to get some food; yet he cannot be persuaded to abstain from wandering about in the wilds of the forest. Another Black, when he saw me, came up and saluted me, as he had just returned from the bush. I told him he looked very thin, after his ramble in the bush. Yes, he replied, and therefore I ought to take him into the room and give him plenty to eat, then he would get fat again. Thus they are cunning enough as regards their stomach, though very indifferent with respect to their souls.
Monday, 7.
When talking to the Blacks, one of them asked me, whether God had made the knife which he held in his hand, and which he had borrowed from one of our men, for the purpose of dividing some meat among themselves. When they are in the bush they tear their meat to pieces not having knives to cut it. The sinews and gristle they sometimes cut with a shell.
Monday, 14.
Br. Watson left us to day to go to Sydney. Observed this evening that only one Black of those who are at present here, came to family prayer. I went to them therefore afterwards, and inquired the reason: all were silent except one, who replied in a witty manner (as he seemed to think it) that he must have some tobacco given him, or he would not come: he could not go to prayer without first having a smoke. May they soon learn and experience that, in attending the divine ordinances and in serving the Lord there is to be found great reward and much delight.
Tuesday, 15.
One of the Blacks by the name of Nerang Jacky, was very troublesome last night and used threatening language to Mrs Watson.
Wednesday, 16.
The Blacks went away this morning, but said they would come back again in a few days. It seems almost impossible for them to stay long at one place.
Monday, 21.
Some of the Blacks came back to day from their excursion. They had promised me to cut some bark when they returned; but did not feel the least incentive now to keep their engagement, their idleness being to great to allow them to do so.
Tuesday, 22.
It is very discouraging to see these poor creatures, when spoken to about the things which belong to their peace, not give them apparently any consideration. But many of the Europeans are as little concerned for their souls as these poor wretched Blacks, and who knows whether the Lord will yet in his own good time reveal unto them his Son, and give them spiritual light and genuine repentance. It is ours to sow though it be with sighing and tears, but the issue must be left to him who must give the increase, and who has said, "My word shall not return empty." One of them in telling me that he was hungry, used an oath to confirm the truth of it. I reproved him, and told him that he should never say so again, as the great God was displeased at it etc. He seemed to be unconscious of having said anything amiss, but promised not to say so any more. They all went away to-day into the bush in order to make young men of some boys.
Thursday, 24.
Succeeded to-day in persuading the Blacks to cut some bark, which is very useful for covering a shed or cot and for several other purposes.
Friday, 25.
The black man, Nerang Jacky, had found honey in the bush, and caught some oppussums besides, so that all of them had plenty to eat. I told them that God was very kind to them in giving them so much food. 'Yes", answered Nerang Jacky, "God that burhery (good) fellow, that gave it mine (my) plenty oppossum." 
Sunday, 27.
Had divine service, the Blacks who are at present here attended. Nerang Jacky began to be again unruly this evening, owing as the other Blacks said, to the crazy fits he is sometimes subject to. By the aid of providence, however, we prevented him from doing injury to any person till he became more calm.
Thursday, 31.
Nerang Jacky went away this evening to fight with another black man by the name of Gentleman Jacky, for a woman, whom each of them called his own. The most singular circumstance is that the women does not live with either; for she has been with white men for some years, and is living with one. Last Monday, Nerang Jacky said he would go to him, and take her away, but when he returned, and I asked him whether he had brought her, he replied, "No, that white fellow mahne it altogedder" (would keep her altogether.)
Friday, November 1.
Nerang Jacky returned this morning, but had not been fighting. A party of other Blacks, about 20 in number, visited us and are yet staying here. They received 36 lb of meat, which they consumed in a very short time; and when I afterwards asked one whether they had had a good meal, he answered, a small one. I endeavoured to speak with them about the great Giver of all good, and wish that it may have proved beneficial to their souls. Brother Watson returned this evening from Sydney.
Saturday, 2.
Some more Blacks came to day, so that there were together with the others, about thirty. Their craving appetites were appeased with fresh meat, an ox having been killed yesterday. Some women also were here, among whom was she, whom I mentioned in my diary under date the first of February, as having been delivered of a half-caste male child. She had the little boy on her back. This child's life, it appeared, had been spared by the mother, which is indeed a rare case among the Blacks of these quarters. For, in general, they kill the half-bred children as you will remember from several instances, recorded in our journals.
Sunday, 3.
Some of the Blacks attended divine service, and conducted themselves in a quiet manner, as they usually do. May we soon have the satisfaction of stating that they hear the word of life with attention and devotion.
Monday, 4.
The Blacks had been fighting last night, and one of them had his arm severely wounded. The occasion of the quarrel was, that one of them had been neglected in dividing the meat which they had received in common for their dinner. Thus in the morning they had been attending divine service (some of them at least) and in the evening a combat took place among them. It was, however, pleasing to observe that one, who is frequently here, one who has not gone with the others, expressed his disapprobation of the conduct of his country-men in fighting, especially on Sunday.
One of the black women belonging to the Wellington tribe, who had been lent by her husband to a white man, and been staying with him a considerable time, was delivered of a child by him a few days ago; and she is said to have burnt the infant as soon as she had given birth to it. O what will be the end of these things, but the diminution of the poor aborigines. May the Lord speedily make bare his saving arm unto them!
Wednesday, 6.
A few Blacks came to day, but they could not be induced to stay, but went away again shortly after their arrival. I endeavoured to talk to them about religion, they paid however no great attention. The chief thought which seemed to occupy their minds, was that they might get something to eat. One women however said, "You pialle burhery" (speak good things.)
Friday, 8.
Two very interesting young black men, who were strangers here, visited us together with several others who had been here before. They said they were brothers and farther to explain themselves they said "Like you and Mr Watson you know", taking it for granted that we also were related, and seeming to suppose that we could not then misunderstand them.
Sunday, 10.
The services were performed as usual. Some of the Blacks also attended.
Saturday, 16.
Again a week has past and I fear I have done very little in promoting our Saviour's kingdom. O that he would speedily appear in his saving strength, that we may not spend or time in vain, and that these poor Blacks no longer remain in darkness.
Sunday, 17.
One of the Blacks called, and desired to speak with me after service. When I asked him what his desire was, he explained that he was hungry, and he wished me to give him something to eat. I thought he had perhaps noticed something in the prayers or in the sermon, but upon inquiring I found he had not paid the least attention to either. May the Lord Jesus for his own sake, give them of his spirit, to attend to his word, and to become his people. We were last week employed in altering and repairing part of a house, at the back of this, to use as a Church as the room which we now use is inconvenient, and sometimes too small for the congregation.

Nothing new, or interesting has happened with regard to the Blacks. May the Lord increase our faith, zeal and love, lest we suffer in our minds, when we find that our endeavours are apparently fruitless. May he also make these poor people sensible of our desire to do them good!

It has been exceedingly dry this season. Our wheat is dried up on the ground, before it came to any perfection: all the labour in ploughing and sowing the ground has been in vain. The cattle are wandering about for food, and can find but little. The vegetables in the garden are withered, so that we have none to eat. There has been rain at several places in our neighbourhood of late, but we were not favoured with any. Something more has been done last week towards the Church. The floor is paved, and the rail, pulpit, and reading desk are erected.

We have had several showers of rain since the last date. The forest and the fields begin now to look green again to the comfort and support of man and beast. Thanks be unto God who again begins to smile upon us by his providence. The Blacks are going and moving to and fro, and we endeavour to speak with them as often as we have an opportunity. I could wish to write something more pleasant and encouraging about them but we are as it were groping in the dark, not seeing much prosperity in our work. No journal of any other Missionary labouring in another field can scarcely be more uninteresting than mine. But though the prospect be dark now, the clouds might be gradually dispersed.

Few Blacks here at present. Their roving disposition does not allow them to stay long at one place. O that the Lord would pity them in their low and most wretched state; and appear with help out of Zion in their behalf!

Left for Sydney with Mrs Handt and the little one. Went about 40 miles to day, to Mr Marsden's station called Molong. There were several Blacks at a small distance from here, to whom I went conversed. One of them, called King Bogen, had accompanied us with his family from the place at Wellington, when we first went there, but since that time he has never visited us. I asked him the reason of his staying away. He replied that he was afraid of the Wellington Blacks, and thought they would kill him, if he went there again. One of his wives, being sick, he desired me to cure her.

King Bogen came this morning to fetch the tobacco which I had promised him last night. Several other Blacks also came, to whom I talked, till we were about to start. I found them extremely ignorant, which circumstance convinced me, that though we may have done but little with regard to the Wellington Blacks, we have, at least, been the means of enlightening their minds in some degree. Did not meet with any Blacks on the road to day.

Met with two Blacks, who it seemed had learned something of the value of money for they asked us for a copper shilling.
