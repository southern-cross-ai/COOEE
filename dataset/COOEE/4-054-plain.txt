Such is love, strange mystic passion! We do not feel that we are satisfied until the solemn vows are spoken and we are one. There is a deep craving while we are separate that feels it's not satisfied until our lives are joined in one. Life now with its various duties cares and joys to be equally shared together. It's a very responsible position one takes when married life is begun. Each should help the other onward, upward, ever growing more united more as one, and if our lives are sanctified ones, this will be the issue.  We each hold a sacred trust and happy indeed will be life together spent if Christ is the Head of our home. Sorrows and trial may come but they cannot take away the peace He gives if we are His alone. How we are both looking forward with joy to the end of the waiting time.
