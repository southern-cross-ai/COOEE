I fear you will not consider the very short narrative herewith forwarded so full as you expected at my hands. I am, however, such a very indifferent hand at description, that I trust you will find what I have written answer your purpose. Accompanying my narrative, I beg to hand to you a copy of a statement, prepared by my brother William, when laying our claims for compensation before the Home Government. I do not see that it will interest you, but it bears out my account of the early settlement of this part of the colony. The difficulties and trials of early settling are, perhaps, better known to myself and two other members of our family than to any other individual in the colony. I have not touched upon any description of the country either at Mount Gambier, or Wannon, and Glenelg, simply because from your knowledge of these parts you are so much more able to do so than myself. I cannot, however, ever forget the pleasant rides that I have had the honour of accompanying you on, on several occasions, over a great deal of the above-named country, and I trust I may live to have an opportunity of doing so again in some other part of the world, as it is my intention (if spared) to visit the old country next year, and I am now making my arrangements accordingly. As another magistrate will be required here, and a friend of my own, Mr. Learmonth, of Ettrick, near Portland, is about to join me in carrying on my business here, I hope you will not consider that I am taking too great a liberty in asking you to put him in the Commission of the Peace, as, having been some years a magistrate in Van Diemen's Land, he is in every way qualified for such an appointment; and again, in begging your kind re-consideration of Dr. Hallett's case, for I really consider him very harshly used by the two individuals who sat with me at the hearing of his case, both of whom had prejudged the case before it came on for hearing.  But for my illness, my report would have been decidedly in his favour, for the only point on which any evidence was given directly rebutted the charge made by Mr. Malpas, that Dr. Hallett returned his own servant as Government office-keeper. There was no evidence whatever to bear out any other charge, but there is evidence now to prove that Mr. Blair wished the man to bear out Mrs. Malpas's statement. But for the death of the unfortunate lady, the case would have been brought forward again. I am sorry to trouble you upon such a subject at a time when I am sure you must be very much worried, but I feel it my duty to state to you my opinion in this case.
Mrs. Henty unites with me in very kind remembrances to you, and may I beg you will convey the same to Mrs. La Trobe, whom I trust you will soon meet in perfect health. With every good wish for such a speedy consummation, and your future welfare and happiness here and hereafter, believe me to remain,
Your sincere friend and admirer,
S. G. HENTY.
1833. - The Henty family residing in Launceston, Van Diemen's Land, being interested in a whaling company, whose operations were carried on along the coast from Portland Bay to Port Fairy, Edward Henty, accompanied by my father, visited Portland Bay during this year, and, finding the country well-grassed and apparently very well adapted for grazing purposes, it was determined by the family upon their return to Launceston to send over stock and other necessaries for an establishment at Portland Bay forthwith; and accordingly Edward Henty accompanied it as manager, and, after a most boisterous passage of four weeks, during which several of the stock died, he reached Portland Bay (1834), and fixed his habitation on what is now block No. 4 in the township of Portland, and now occupied by me. 
My father at this time applied to the Home Government for permission to exchange some portion of our large grant of land at Swan River for a smaller portion here, which, however, was refused; but what we considered a tacit permission was given for us to occupy and to claim such lands as we might improve by fencing or cultivation. Our subsequent operations bear out that we depended upon this concession; the sequel, however, shows that we were mistaken.
1834. - In December of this year my brother Frank joined the party at Portland, bringing over more stock and servants.
1835. - Early in the following year it was necessary for F. Henty to return to Van Diemen's Land. On his return to Portland in October of this year, the small sloop in which he was a passenger called on her way at Indented Head, where they found Batman's party waiting an opportunity to get further up the Bay of Port Phillip. He took advantage of this opportunity, and proceeded with the party up the Yarra Yarra, when the party camped for the first time on the present town-site of Melbourne. After remaining there for a fortnight, he proceeded on his voyage, and reached Portland again in November 1835.
At this time the writer was residing at Swan River, to which colony he had emigrated from England as one of the pioneers of that colony at its earliest settlement in October 1829. Learning from my brothers at Portland that they had taken up their location there, and being urged by them to join them, I at once determined on doing so, and in order to effect this I purchased a vessel of sixty tons called the Sally Ann, and embarked with my wife and servants, and reached Portland in June 1836. The vessel was afterwards employed as a tender upon the party, running regularly between Portland and Launceston. At this time we were entirely dependent upon ourselves, both for supplies from Van Diemen's Land and for protection against the natives and the many runaway prisoners who were at large at and around the whaling establishment. 
1836. - It was in August of this year that a portion of Major Mitchell's party, headed by himself, visited our establishment, when to his astonishment he found our party comfortably settled (having, as he expressed himself, the only glass windows to our house that he had seen since he left the boundary of New South Wales). Not being aware of any settlement at this place, he supposed that we were a party of bushrangers or runaways from Van Diemen's Land, and, in approaching us, he took the precaution to have his men ranged in order, with their arms ready for action. This led us to suppose that his party was what he supposed ours to be, and we were consequently as cautious before holding any intercourse with him.
From Major Mitchell we learnt that the country about 50 miles north was much more suitable for grazing purposes than where our stock was located, and as our sheep had accumulated to several thousands it was considered advisable to push into the interior. To enable us to do this, we cut a trackway through the forest to Mount Eckersley, and there took up stations until we could get further inland.
1837. - It was not until the 3rd of August in this year that we succeeded in driving our first flock on to the Merino Downs Station - a day that will be memorable in the recollection of the family of the writer as the natal day of his first-born son, Richmond. The remainder of our stock was sent up as fast as possible, with which we occupied the stations known as Muntham, Connell's run, and Sandford. At this time we had very great difficulty in retaining the services of any men, owing to the hostile disposition of the natives, to which many of our men's lives were sacrificed.
1838. - In this year, Mr. Samuel Winter came over from Van Diemen's Land, and shortly afterwards took up a station called Tahara, adjoining our Merino Downs run.  Shortly afterwards Mr. John Bryan came over; and when it became known in Van Diemen's Land that we had opened up a road into the interior many other gentlemen followed our example.
1840. - Among others, in 1840, were Messrs. Pilleau and Jones, McCulloch, Purbrick, Savage, J. G. Robertson, Coldham, McPherson, and many others, until all the country immediately around us was taken possession of. It was in October of this year that the first land sale took place, and which deprived us of some of that land upon which we had made improvements at so much expense to ourselves - some of it realizing at the rate of Â£1,600 an acre.
The South Australian Government held out very great inducements for the selection of special surveys. This induced me to take a journey across the boundary of this colony in search of some suitable spot on the coast within the colony of South Australia; and for this purpose I prepared a party of two men and myself, and took my deparutre from Merino Downs in June 1839, steering a direct course by compass for Mount Gambier, which I reached on the second day. To those who have not seen Mount Gambier it may seem strange when I say that I ascended it by a very gentle slope on the north-east side, and was scarcely aware of my exact position until I reached the brink of the enormous eastern lake, a sight which I never can forget - quite beyond my power of description. At this time I was not certain whether this beautiful country belonged to the South Australian colony, or I should at once have applied for a special survey in that locality, for at this time I believe no European had ever seen the country but my own party. Under this doubt, I determined to push further on, and examine the coast line as far as Cape Jaffa, and therefore extended my search for 28 days without success, and returned along the coast to Portland. We afterwards formed cattle stations at Mount Gambier, of which we were subsequently deprived by the chicanery of some unprincipled individuals in search of sheep stations.  This part of the country is now thickly settled. The export in wool alone from the port of Portland this season will reach to about 12,000 bales, or in money value nearly Â£300,000, and traffic consequent upon this is now very great.'
Port Fairy was (like Portland, but subsequently) settled first by the formation of a whaling party, and afterwards stock was introduced from Van Diemen's Land by Messrs. Conolly and Griffiths, but, owing to the very great expense attending it, both these gentlemen were ruined.
The trade to Portland from Great Britain is very considerable, no less than eight large vessels having arrive direct within the last twelve months fully laden with cargo - one of them, the Aberdeen clipper Frances Henty, belonging to the writer - besides some emigrant ships, ranging from 1,350 tons down to 650 tons.
