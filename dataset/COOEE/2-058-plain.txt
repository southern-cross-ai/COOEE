RETURN OF THE YORK
Sydney, 8 April, 1831.
We have to announce the gratifying news of the safe return to port of the ship York, together with the equally pleasing intelligence, that the apprehensions for the safety of the crew, which a chain of circumstances occasioned in the public mind, turn out to be altogether groundless.
She anchored this evening, about dark in Watson's Bay, the passengers and crew all well From the hasty particulars which we have been enabled to glean, it appears, that her parting from the Edward was occasioned by a strong northerly wind, which induced Captain Leary to alter his course, and endeavour to make the passage through Bass' Straits.
When the ship was hailed by Captain Gilbert from the Edward, the wind was so high, that nothing more than a confused sound could be distinguished on board, and, being unable to lay-to, she proceeded on her course; the wind subsequently veered to the southward, and, after beating about the Straits for several days, Captain Leary thought it most advisable to return to Sydney.
We are most happy at being thus enabled satisfactorily to allay the ferment which a rumour so astounding in all the alleged circumstances which gave rise to it, was calculated to excite, not only in this Colony, but in every part of the British dominions to which it might reach.
We are rejoiced thus to deliver the army from the greatest reproach. We considered Captain Gilbert's account worthy of credit. We now think that Captain Leary and Captain Gilbert must one or both have acted a most uncandid part towards each other. But in the absence of information we shall be silent.
It behoves Captain Gilbert to clear himself from the odium of having made such representations as to induce the public journals here, relying first on his veracity, secondly on his good sense as a gentleman, and thirdly on his experience as a sailor, to believe that part of one of the most gallant and distinguished regiments in his Majesty's service had mutinied, and in conjunction with the sailors piratically run away with the ship! It now appears that no such idea ever entered the minds of the brave and loyal soldiers on board, and that honour was never absent from their breasts one moment.
On the other hand, as, according to Captain Gilbert's account Captain Leary altered his course, contrary to express agreement with him, and had one of Captain Gilbert's charts of Torres' Straits on board which he had borrowed, we suppose Captain Leary will explain and set himself right with the public on this score. But why, having the superior ship of the two under his feet, should Captain Gilbert have been so afraid of being boarded by the York, as not to have continued in company with her until he had ascertained her real situation?
Why leave her suddenly, and by his insinuations to the public here, and through the Journals to the whole world, cause all men to consider her a Pirate? Such conduct is really marvellous, and will tell very little for Captain Gilbert at Lloyd's, when he shews there again.
