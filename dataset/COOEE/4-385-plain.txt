Whenever they found out that I was an Irish Protestant they both had a set on me, with the result I had to leave my Billet to make room for a man who owed the firm a lot of money. The rumour went round that I would have to leave to let this man get my situation so I wrote out my resignation to give them, as I had another better situation offered to me if I would take it, in the Shipping line too, but I was advised to not give in my resignation until I first asked this Mr. Doyle if there were any truth in the rumour that was going. He said to me no there are no truth in it Witherow and don't believe any lying reports, so I took his word as truth and did not give him my resignation and one week after that he came to me and said Witherow your time will finish in a week so what do you think of an old scoundrel like that. I lost the other situation through his telling me lies, so I have never dropped into a good permanent situation since.
