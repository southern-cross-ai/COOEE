I bought a pair of trousers at 20s., a pair of fine boots at 22s. a pair of every day boots at 14s. a good hat at 10s. 6d. and I have joined the Good Templars which cost me half a crown and a devil of a lot of medicine, for let what come or go I have always to have a good supply of it. You must not think because I am using a good deal of medicine that I am worse. If I can pass the winter as well as I have done for so far I will be satisfied.
