Ned Heggan was saying that it was near time I had my speal of her; you were saying that Aunt Marget is going to America. I wish she would come to me but it is a long way but I could give her a good home. James is married and William will be in lodgings; she would suit me very well; she might not care for so quiet a place as farming in the bush of Australia. I do all my owen cooking; it takes up a good deal of my time; she would be comfortable and would like the climat very well and I believe her and I would get along very well; if she is not gone away you might see what she would think of it; she will think it rather unkind of me never writing to her.
