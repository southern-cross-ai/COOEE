At that late hour of the evening he was, he found, to come forward and speak to a toast which must of necessity, and peculiarly so in that assemblage, call forth the deepest and holiest feelings of human emotion. He could have wished, so sensible was he of the difficulty of doing justice to the task imposed upon him, that it had fallen upon some one better qualified than himself to reply to the toast of "The Patriots of Ireland." It would require the sweet notes of Ireland's own mournful music, with its mixture of darkness and sorrow and military pride, to fitly sing their requiem, to evoke strains which could adequately celebrate the renown of the patriots of Ireland. 
Ireland had sent forth her gallant sons by thousands to fight upon the bloody fields of France and Spain, of Belgium and Austria, of North America, and other quarters of the globe, and their daring deeds had reflected undying glory upon the annals of their country's fame. In every field of literature the fairest chaplet had been won and worn by Irishmen, who had distinguished themselves as scholars, poets, painters, sculptors, authors, and as aspirants and victors in every honourable path in life ; but of all those of her many gifted children, those whom Ireland loved best, were neither her artists, her painters, her poets, nor her sculptors, but her own dear patriot sons, who had struggled for her in her hour of need, and now sleep in their unhonoured graves. 
Perhaps she loved them the more because their efforts on her behalf had not been crowned with those splendid successes with which patriotism elsewhere has been so often blessed. The Englishman was proud of his Hampden and the other great names which adorn his history; the Frenchman glowed with pride at the remembrance of those who had achieved so much for the freedom and greatness of his nation ; but in other lands, such as Italy, Hungary, and Ireland, there was a deeper and tenderer feeling connected with the memory of patriots. In those countries their heroic labours had not hitherto been blessed with a due measure of success, yet they were passionately loved and fondly remembered, for had they not done their dear utmost? They had ever bravely and loyally done what they believed to be right, what they were convinced was for their country's welfare. 
Mr. Deniehy having thus spoken of those of Ireland's patriots who might be regarded as the martyrs to ideas on political questions that were open to difference of opinion, passed on to pay a splendid tribute to those who might be termed the Constitutional Patriots of Ireland, to Curran, Henry Grattan, Chief justice Bushe, and others of that gallant band who had fought shoulder to shoulder for Irish independence. 
In conclusion he warmly urged upon those present the necessity of purity of action in working out the idea of responsible government in this country; recalling in glowing language the time when the Union was carried in the memorable year 1800, - carried by the suicidal vote of a base, corrupt, and venal parliament, - carried in spite of the god-like efforts of Curran and the handful of brave spirits who had ranged themselves under his banner.
