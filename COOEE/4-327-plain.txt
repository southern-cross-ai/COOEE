Willie Trotter was equally unfortunate; am pleased that he has got a good situation in America. He was with us about a week and enjoyed himself very much. I recognised him at once, thought he looked Johnie. When he left us he intended going to America if he did not drop into a situation of some kind in Melbourne; did not hear from him until he was on his way to America  
you cannot take too much fresh fish or fowl; never take salt fish or herrings. Never be tempted to eat potatoes and salt or potatoes and herrings when going to bed. This used to be a favourite dish in Ballygannah, enough to give a horse indigestion. 
Maggie is just home from Sunday School. I am relieved of that now, having the leadership of about 40 young men who meet in class every Friday night at the Church.  We are enjoying good health although I suffered a good deal from worry and anxiety after moving into the new shop
