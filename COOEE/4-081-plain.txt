 there is one part of John's letter with which I cannot agree in which he says that there is still land to select under not more difficulties than in earlier times. Well the first difference is the best of the land is selected. What is left is covered with wood and under-growth. There is less of the public domain to select from and more difficult to get a selection or farm. Then if the farmer had to draw his wheat a long way to market he had surely a better price than 3s. 9d. per bushel. If I was farming here I would not go heavily into crop growing as I believe stock would pay better at present, with less labour.
