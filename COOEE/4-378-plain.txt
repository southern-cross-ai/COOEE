He is putting on as many sheep as he can manage to buy; thinks prices will advance owing to the scarcity of sheep in the Northern districts caused by the drought. He is not very favourable towards my going West having had bad reports. These reports were principally from miners who simply rushed the place and when exemption set in (mines stopped work for say 3 to 4 months for want of water which has been gradually overcome through people making dams and sinking for water) they were thrown out of work. 
I see by today's paper that the gold yield for Coolgardie has been splendid. Coolgardie is about 200 miles from Fremantle. The latter is a shipping port for the former as well as Kalgoorlie and other gold fields so you see there is bound to be a good deal of traffic. 
Young Rankin who used to be at Agnew's when I was there (I think you met him) went to Coolgardie about 18 months ago. He has done remarkably well. The little fellow Woodward who was with me for 5 years left and went to Fremantle, got a situation second day after he landed; is still in the place in a large ironmongery store besides numerous others that I know have done well.
