For some months the hot weather was so oppressive that I had to sleep outside my hut sometimes at night but I did not feel inclined for a bit of sleep for fear of a snake visiting me. The people made such complaints about the bugs, mosquitoes, fleas in such numbers whilst in bed at night, we had to use the Carbonic acid for their destruction. We have got plenty of bread at last. Before it came the good drinking water was very scarce. Since I last wrote telling you how I got on at digging, I am still getting but a good deal less gold; much more poorer than at the beginning. Before I came in sight of a speck I had to draw a few pounds out of the bank as to keep me agoing. 
 I do all the house works myself except fine shirts which my nearest neighbour a wife of an old Dublin seaman washes for me at a charge of 4d. a piece; a native of near London, she is the one that makes clothes for me and other people; a very good dressmaker and tailoress. I have a nice cat for company for me. She follows me like a dog to where I works. The moment she sees anyone or dog she runs into holes till she is sure of them being gone out of sight.  She sometimes stands a chance of catching rabbits; the hares are becoming plenty. Unfortunately, I have no gun to shoot them. 
I am not doing much good at digging just now. There was a heavy fall of rain last Friday all day and night which caused a deal of earth to fall in a new hole I am sinking  
Most of my neighbours who cant get gold on these diggings on which I live, looks for work as labourers. I fear I shall take their example when all the gold is swalled out of it. hard to tell what the people will do after. I live by myself in a very good view of Castlemaine, half an hour's walk so that I don't mind being lonely. Last week I got a present of a good lot of grapes and apples and pears from a wealthy gardener. He has a fine large orchard about half hour's walk from my hut. He like a good many miners made lots of money shortly after the gold was first discovered which enabled them to build fine houses on their own land. Castlemaine is beginning to be a fine town, with some fine public buildings (the Post Office particularly)  My dear Maria, many thanks for your kind letter of 18th March which was sent to me by my store-keeper whilst lying bad with dysentery with piles at the hospital so I know that you would not accuse me of my negligence in replying to it sooner. I got sick for a time before he recommended me as a member of the committee to go at once to become an in-patient which I found more comfortable with plenty of attendants and attention than my hut. He took me there in his own tax cart. I lost a deal of blood passing till it disappeared on my leaving it, but I am not quite well yet. Going up high hills causes me to breathe hard, unlike before. I don't remember having ever been sick of any dangerous disease after or before I left Ireland so I am thankful to God for his kindness in taking the complaint from me. The hospital is a splendid building with a fine view of Castlemaine from the top of a hill about one and a half miles from my hut. Some of the patients were of respectable families at home; amongst was a cousin of the celebrated explorer Bourke of whom you would certainly read in the papers. I had plenty of visitors particularly miners. Some brought me sorts of cakes and jams etc. whilst at the hospital. The surgeon Dr. McGrath is a North of Ireland man, said to be the cleverest doctor in all Castlemaine. From 6 to 8 deaths took place. My diet was such a weak one which consisted of sago burgoo porridge, boiled milk, boiled bread, pudding, rice, tea, fresh butter, bread with a good supply of milk and medicines along with a little brandy every day and night till I found myself getting better when the doctor ordered me to live on soup with meat, potatoes, eggs, bread, tea, milk; just before I was fit to come home he put me to the expense of drinking port wine for a month which was pretty hard on me  
The weather here has been a bitterly cold one for sometime past with some rains so that I have to make good fires to keep myself warm. I am happy to say that I am now enabled to cut firewood as to save the expense of hiring any more load. Shortly after I came home I had to order 2 loads till I was well enough to start to dig for gold about 4 weeks ago after getting none since I left the hospital.
