It requires a year or so to let the grass get a closs bottom after ringing. John left here for Gippsland a year ago tomorrow. It seems but half the time. He has ordered a lot more groceries, also his honey extractor (this is a machine for taking the honey out of the bar frames without damaging the combs). I purpose going to see him at Christmas at same time inspect my estate.  In a letter some time ago John mentioned that a man the name of Johnston (our neighbour) had sold his block of land for £800 I think he said if Johnston's was worth that the block in my name was worth £500. I am inclined to think that John is over valuing it but we will suppose the half of that amount. It ain't bad is it? 
You will all be pleased to know that I got my title deed for Braybrook a month ago. It is not very large. You will understand it is for building purposes. The frontage is 120 feet by 120 feet deep which is large enough for 6 cottages. There has been some lands sold convenient at one pound per foot. Robbie Hanna advises me to hold to it. He believes it will be worth two pounds per foot in another year or so. However I may be obliged to sell sooner as I would like to put as much steam into Gippsland as possible. And another thing I would like a little of that money so that I would be able to make a little home in case I thought of getting the better half.
