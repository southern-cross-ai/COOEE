 in mind you can do twice as well in Ireland as you could possibly do in Qland. There are some families from about Ennistymon out here who would give all they are worth to be back again. Michael Kean and his family are living here in Brisbane. I have visited them a few times. He desired me to remember him to you & my Mother. 
My dearest Mama
I hope this letter will find you all in good health. You were saying in your last that my Father was bad from Rheumatism. It pained me verry much to hear that he was still suffering from it but I hope he is better by this. 
Ned Thyne & his family are living in Ipswich about 20 miles from here, I will see them please God on tomorrow. Michl Herbert & Austin Carrigg live there also. I met Austin Grady & Michl the other day here in town. They are in good health and doing well. 
My dear Mother
I Know that you are thinking me very ungrateful at home not to have sent home some money or sent for any of my uncles family since but God Knows it did not lie in my power to do it as I would wish and another thing I dont think that I would be the means of bringing anyone to Australia. It is such a miserable place and still people at home will not believe it. They imagine that money is easily had here until they experience it and then they begin to curse themselves for ever coming out. There is not a person in this country but has to work for their living. There is nothing like money to be made in it. Father Devitte my old college companion is a priest in town, an one or two more of the boys.  So you see that I have some to talk to. 
How are all my Brothers & Sisters and friends. I often wish to see you all again which I will please God if we are  for it. Is John still in . Make him write to me this time. Mary never sends me a line - at any rate we never pulled well and I suppose she has an old spite for me. Do not forget to tell me how poor "Dowdle" is in your next is he fond of fishing now. Do not forget Dear Mother to give trades to all of them. Is little Bid in good health? Tell me how my Aunt Russell is & also my grandmother. You would Confer a great favour by sending the portrait of yourself & my father to me in one to me by next post, if you can, and I will send mine the post after. Do not forget  at once. With sincere  affection I remain Dear Parents 
Your affectionate Son
