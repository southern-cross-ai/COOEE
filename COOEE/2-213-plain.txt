My Dear Capt. Piper,
I am sufficiently acquainted of old with your disposition to do good whenever an opportunity offered of doing so to make any Apology for addressing you on the present occasion without further ado I will say that a poor Lady from Bathurst, a Mrs. Bohun, whose husband is in Gaol there and who belongs to a most respectable family in England has written to Lady O'Connell a most soul harrowing letter describing the station of misery and starvation to which she and a family of helpless children are reduced having no means of support but a trifle she earns by establishing a school which is as yet very thinly attended - The poor woman declares that for 10 Days previous to her writing she and her children had not tasted a morsel of Bread altho her letter was written on the 16th of the present month it only reached as this morning - Lady O'Connell sends by this days Post a trifle to keep her from starvation for a short time but as in consequence of the heavy expenses I have been at for my outfit and establishment here it will be impossible for me to aid this poor woman as I would wish.
I wish to recommend her case to the humane and charitable aid as you are in her immediate neighbourhood you can in any way and in alleviating the dire distress of this poor woman you will be doing a most meritorious act. - I know nothing of Mrs. Bohun or of her husband but she is connected with persons in England whom we have a very great regard for - Such as Lady Catharine Bishett the Sister of Lord Suffolk  and the late Lady Brownrigg  of the late Sir Robert Brownrigg who were both our particular friends - perhaps your interest may  join of the families in your neighbourhood to send their children to her school. in any way that you could put the poor woman in the way of obtaining the means of procuring bread for her helpless familiy. I repeat you will be performing a most meritorious act and you will oblige Lady O'Connell who joins me in kindest remembrance to you as well as yours
