 I am over a fortnight in my new crib. It is a very quiet little town. I am getting along pretty well for so far. The hours are from 8.30 to 6 and 10 pm. Saturday. We have not too hard to work, there not being a great rush of customers. They seem to get a good profit so that makes up. 
There is a young man came up a week after me for the clothing department. He is a new chum from Magherafelt, Co. Derry. His name is Vance. He is fine company for me. We are the only two assistants and we stop in the same lodgings. Our lodgings cost 20s. a week; we are very comfortable. Of course there is no other lodgers here. 
The governor of our drapery side is a Presbyterian, so is Vance (there is also groceries kept but next door). Vance and I had a long walk up the mountain about three miles from here. Away on the other side of the mountain we could see the valley of the Goulburn River. This place is a little south of the Goulburn. From Melbourne we came about 40 miles by train and 30 by coach. It is a wonderful journey through the bush. The road is not the best; some parts of it is only a bush track. It is something strange to hear the morepork (the Australian cuckoo) calling at night. It is quite a different bird. The call is something like mo-pork and is not so sweet as the cuckoo and much slower
