Sir. - In your issue of the 8th inst. I find the first of an intended series of articles upon labour, remuneration, &c. Taking as granted you are sincere in your profession of good will, and wish only fair statements to be made, I beg to offer a few remarks, and respectfully request space for them. You say in 1863 a workman obtains about £2 14s. in wages weekly, and that himself, wife, and three children can live upon £1 18s. 7d. the same time. Now, allowing some of the items of food to be charged full and others under, I think it a fair statement upon the whole, as far as it goes (except rent); but you have not made any reference to several expenses not altogether unworthy of your kind remembrance. No provision is made for the education of his children, or for their attendance at any public place of worship or instruction. No sum set apart for the sundries which a good mother can so justifiably fill up; no provision for increase of family or for sickness, for loss of work, or subscription to benefit or building society - not even for green vegetables or fruits, which they say are necessary for health here. I do not mention beer or wine, though "a little wine for stomach's sake and often infirmity" is not an infidel recommendation. Then, again, I question whether the decorum of a well-regulated family can be carried out in nine cases out of ten in dwellings at 6s. per week, so that a larger sum would have to be put down to rent. I have merely stated a few facts, feeling personally their importance, and leave to abler hands the bearing it has upon the character and conduct of the rising generation, who are to take the place sometime their parents now occupy; and believing injustice or ungenerousness will never raise or maintain anything like a desirable state of things, I hope, for the working-man, as well as for the man of capital, you will raise your voice against the selfishness of mammon.
Yours, M.
N.B. The foregoing remarks are against the presumption he can save 15s. 6d. per week.
(It will readily be seen that our correspondent's remarks do not affect the validity of our comparison between the working man's receipts and expenditure of the two periods in question.)
