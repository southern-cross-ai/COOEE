There has been a great many strikes in various classes of labour which have done a great deal of harm. In Melbourne the shopkeepers have a great deal of surplus stock left on their hands after their winter trade which they are now selling at very low prices in order to clear stocks which of course shows that trade is dull and money scarce. 
I had a letter from Mr. Wilson last week. He thinks that Mr. Johnston will re-take the grazing of the paddock for another term. We left the garden and beehives to Mr. Wilson at a nominal rate as the things - fruit trees, beehives, etc, will be better looked after than they otherwise would be. It is just possible that I may go on the land about this time next year. Things would be better looked after and seen to besides there is not much sign of a rise in the drapery trade and I might be better off in the long run on the land. I will wait the development of circumstances and weigh carefully the best course to pursue.
