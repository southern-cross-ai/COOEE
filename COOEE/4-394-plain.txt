I did my 200 acre job of ringing in 4 weeks making £4 a week. This is a record for the district, 8 weeks being the average time. Tucker cost 10s. 0d. a week as I shot my own meat. I worked like a nigger as it was life or death with me. I have I think another job coming off after Christmas 100 (acres) at £8 10s. 0d. the lot and I am sure I can do it in a fortnight if the weather keeps cool. It is 104 degrees in the shade now and has been for weeks. We generally work from 6 to 11, have dinner and a siesta, work again at 2 and knock off half six then bathe, tea, smoke and bed. It is black as a dungeon at quarter past eight. 
I feel the want of some stock badly and cannot really make anything off the place till I get some of my own. The £25 rent is what takes making up and a fellow can't always get work. 
My trees look very well considering the heat. It must be 140 degrees in the sun as we often have it 160 degrees a little later and such a fierce heat too, if your sleeves are rolled up a bit higher than usual you will have all the skin peel off in 10 minutes and the ground is like a brick. I shot a large emu this morning running over 200 yards, broke his leg but flukes count you know every time.
