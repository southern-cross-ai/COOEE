 I feel sure that if the whole family could have come and taken up selections and used the same industry they have done at home that in the course of 10 or 15 years or perhaps less they would be worth a bit more money than they would be at home or I may say the land would be worth the money for in the course of 10 years land will not be to had and in this way its value will increase. 
We don't know what William is likely to tackle first. Our idea is stock raising and if we can get things to our minds we will give it a trial. Of course it is up hill work for a year or two but if a man is able to hold his own for the first 3 years he may consider himself pretty safe and after that with the improvements that is put on, the land is worth a bit of money. You see the Government pays as high as Â£10 per acre for improvements. 
The great drawback here with farmers or people that pretend to be farmers or stock raisers is that more than the half of them knows nothing whatever about it; thus they are kept feeling their way for years. I firmly believe if William gave it a trial that he would succeed, unless he is much changed from what he used to be. 
I am sure you are all busy preparing for them starting. I have just been speaking to Mrs. Welby our landlady and making arrangements for William and Sarah. She Mrs. W shall be very glad to accommodate them. They will feel more at home with us than with strangers and Mrs. Welby will be nice company for Sarah and the little one until they get settled. I will write to Adelaide so that they will get instructions three days before they arrive at Williamstown, Melbourne. The Hanna family and us have arranged to go and welcome them. 
10 November  we are glad that William is leaving Newtownards. I never liked the idea of him going round and serving the bread.
