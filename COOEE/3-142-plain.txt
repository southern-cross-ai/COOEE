Dear Sister I must tell you a litle about work. I am still in the same place only in a differe name, I told you of. The times hav changed. Now it is the firm of Gault & Scott. The ar from your part of Ireland. I expect you have herd of the Name. When our shop closed I had 5 weeks holidays and I had a letter from them to know if I would go back in the old shop again so I except the offer, as I prefered it to a strange shop, and it was to their advantage to have an old hand, for I new all the costomers. We opene the 15 December. I am as happy as ever. Things are going on just the same. I am quite my own Mistress, none to dictate to to me. I am all alone that is without annother female so I have my litle bedroom which I told you of all to myself. I should like you to see it. 
I ought to be thankfull when I hear those around me mourning, and particularly my own frinds, that is Poor Aunt Mary family which I will tell you a little of. I feel dear Sister Goodness and Mercys has followed me all the days of my life, and I trust these Blessings and provviding will never rise up in Judgement against me. God forbid, but may the be the means of leeding me near to him, who is the Giver of them. I think I told you before that I had become quite a Wesleyan I hope not in Name only but in heart. I have been one now for 4 years and I hope I shall Dye one, and I trust a Good one. But it does not mater what you ar by Name as long as you belong to that one church that is the church of God, and I hope we are all united to that one. 
I had a long and interesting letter from deer Mary Wyly in America, but as usual I wrote to her first when I found her directions. She told me of her dear Mothers death, and how happy she dyed. She never had her helth after she left home. Her constant ailing proved a decline something in which caused her death. Poor things the have had their trubble. 
She tells me she never herd of Charles since He left home. I believe that broke Poor Aunt Marys heart, and Robert was a great sorce of trubble to them, he is at Sea.  George is such a good Boy and in a Situation in draper shop, Bessy & Mary lives together. Bessy is in a Shop now, and Mary goes out to Needlework. The found it very hard to get on. I believe the had a great struggle to get on. I believe by the strain of her letter Fanny was any thing but kind to them even to the dear Mother. It was her dying wish that she would not depend on Fanny do what the will but that. Bessy and Her lived with her till she dyed. Fanny is Married very well, and shares her happiness with no one but her self and child. You will be surprised to hear that, for I was. I always thought Fanny was the Modell of the family. 
Mary asked me my advice about comeing here. I should like to have them very much, for the would be such companions for me, altho I never have been without one yet, but the all get Maried and go off. I wonder Mary has not gone before this, but she tell me she has put her self on the list of old Mades. I must tell you I have not quite done that, but I never shall chance my name unless I do so for the better for I am very happy as I am. I can get  many that will have me but I wont have them so you need not fear but I will Tudge well that is with other help. I trust I shall always look to Him who is the Strong for Strength to Gide my steps in to the right path and I am asured I shall never go wrong. 
Dear Matilda I was surprised to here Aunt Lucy has not herd from me. Would you plase to tell her, I have written twice and never got an answer, in fact 3 times but the first I got returned. I inclosed one for her in Ruth to Aunt a to Nace  as Aunt Jane directed, but we got both returned. Tell her to write, and send me her propper diretions and I shall be to happy to write again. Aunt E has written to her sevrl times and she never gets an answer. 
I inclose you a piece of deer Thomases hair as you say you had not any. I thought perhaps dear Susan would like to have a bit to put in a Brooch some day. I have a few set myself in one. I also send her a Soverine as a little present if she likes to by one for my sake. I hope it will get safe. I shall register it. If it should get safe I shall send Edward one nex time, Plas God if nothing perforce ocurs to prevent. Everthing seems to go and come so nicely, that we may send any thing almost. I only wish we would get home and back so easy. Aunt E liked her Collar so much. I am sure it was very kind of you, but you do not know how we prize them. I thought first of sending Susan a Book but I thought that would be more usefull and she could by what she liked with it herself. 
Please write by the next mail. I shall be anciously waiting. We ar all so delighted to here from home, the arrival of the English mail causes such an excitement in ths place. 
I soppose you did not understand my asking you for the Register of my Fathers Family the Births. If you remember Thomas had it, and I new it would be no use to you. I should be Glad to have it, that is if you should not want it. 
Dear Sister I shall be anciously waiting and looking out for your & dear Thomas likeness which if I understood your letter write you ar going to send them by next post. I shall prize them much, as you say it will be the family. I look forward to that day when we shall make one unbroken family in Heaven, it is the only consolation we have on this side of the grave and with out it we should be misruble. Then dear Sister let me take currage and go onward with these lines 
And what is all we suffer now
Or all we can endure below
To that bright day when Christ shall come 
And take his weary Pilgrams home. 
Then let me walk without complaint
The thorny route and never faint
Tho now by wearyness opprest
The end is everlasting Rest.

I must conclude wishing you and yours all the happiness both in this world and the next, and may the Lord Bless you and comfort you under evr  tryal and trubble he may please to place you under, and Give you His Grace. That may be sufficient for you to see all things will work together for our Good. That is the sincere Prayer of your fond Sister.
