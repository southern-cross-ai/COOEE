It was with the shipping that the strike first started as the sailors were all union men so then the ship owners got blackleg labour to run the boats, so the coal miners would not let the boats get coal, so steam boats and railways have been stopped. The Government sent large forces of police and volunteers to shoot the men down but the men all turned out to a man and were well armed and drove the police and volunteers back and took some of the cannons of them that the Government sent to shoot the miners with, so now the miners will shoot them with them; the men are stiking  well together and the Government can't do nothing with them, so I think the strike will soon be settled. 
I have been away from Broken Hill for a short time, as we have all been out on strike for the last 17 weeks and no telling when we will go to work again. The mine owners was wanting to lower the wages, so the men all struck to a man; there is 7,000 men on strike; we struck on the 4th July last, so things are in a very bad state in Broken Hill, as there is no other work but minen in this part of New South Wales so all the men are walking about the streets. There has been about 1,500 men left the Hill since the strike. There has been some ruff work here since the strike as the mine owners have been fetching miners from other parts so the government have sent large bodies of police to keep law and order; there has been some shots fired but no lives lost as yet, there are 8 of our leaders in jail; their trial is going on at present; we all thought that they would get about five years but I think the way the trial is going that they will get off with a short term; they are all married but three.
