My dear Miss Lewin, I am now so reconciled to Australia that I was surprised to see by your letter I had apparently been disappointed at first. At times I feel it is rather dull work never to go beyond the garden or Croquet ground but then I remember I can rake or hoe in the garden as I please & freedom to please oneself more than compensates for monotony. Occasionally we have a good deal of riding, & I have a nice horse for my own use - then if Mr Hines is busy we are sometimes weeks without going outside the gates.
Latterly there has been a great deal of gaiety for this place - one public Ball & two private ones - one of the private ones here. The style is to dance till daylight, because it is impossible to ride or drive in the dark, so those who must go, dance until it is light enough to start & the rest take thankfully anything they can get in the shape of a bed - when it comes to provide for thirty you cannot be very particular. 
I felt the heat much more this summer than last - but then it was more continued. & unusually severe - this part is nearly as hot as Adelaide - I hope this Xmas to be able to take a trip to my brother & sister. Travelling there is very very expensive & last year I felt economical - I remain dear Miss Lewin
Very truly yours
