My Dear Edward 
I hope you do not think it unkind of me not answering your kind letters but I always have been almost to late with my letters for the mails. I was delighted to hear from you. It proves to me you have not quite forgotten your poor Aunt, the only one that is alive to you. I was delighted to hear you were getting on so well, and was such a Good Boy. I shall not be able to call you that long for I soppose you ar almost quite a Man by this time. If you were here you would make me feel quite old. I wish you were, and I should be able to look to you as my big Protector. 
How would you like to come to Adelaide. How do you like your situation as a Station. I expect when you ar out of your time, and should you come here you would do well here. There are some nice Stationers Shops here. 
I hope your dear Mama is quite well and dear little Susan. I speak of her as I left her a Baby in arms. I should so like you all here. I hope you will some day. I hope your dear Mama received my last letter, I inclosed a half soverin in it for Susan as a little present. I hope when I hear of the safe arival of that I shall send you another, but I did not like to trust another until I herd if that got safe. I sent one half sovrin to dear Aunt Lucy. She is so badly off, Poor thing in her old age it is hard to see her want, and she has been so good to others. I hope your dear Mama will go to see her and comfort her. I know she cannot do much but a kind word does a deal for some people. Do you ever see her. Do you ever go to Dublin. I received your likeness and was delighted with them. I Remember your face well, I think it must be a good likeness. Your Mama dident say if the were good. I propose sending mine in return to you that is if you will except it. I soppose you almost forgot me. 
The Children in North Adelade all sends their love to vou and Susan & Mama, also Mrs. Shadgett and family. Robert intends writing and enclosing it in this so he will tell you all the newes. He has become quite a draper after 3 years apprentice to it. Alaxander Wyly that is Poor Uncle Roberts son is also a draper and doing well. 
I soppose you herd of Poor Henrys death. I think I mention it in your Mamas letter. He would not be gided by any one but took his own way, so he met with his end at last. He died alone in Melburne without a frind to soothe his pillow, at leas without a relitave. 
Dear Edward I often think of the happy days in Rathmines. I soppose you forget all but I never will. There has been many changes since then, but we cannot expect anything more in this world but changes. I trust we ar all looking fward to that day of rest that happy day of meeting, when our trubles shall be turned to Joy, and meeting will be to part no more, and we shall make one unbroaken family in Heaven. 
I trust dear Edward you will be a comfort to your dear Mama, as she has no one but you and your dear Sister to comfort her. I was delighted to hear you were all you your dear Mama could wish you to be since your dear Papas death. I trust you will still continue to be so. 
I send you a scene of Adelaide about 10 years ago. I shall send you one of this years scenes by next mail, so that you will see the improvement in the place. I thought you would like to see it. Tell me what you think of it. 
You must excuse this horrid scribble for you will see it is horrid paper to write on and I am in great hast to be in time for the mail. As one of the Children intends writing I shall say no more for I expect the will tell you more newes that will interest you than I can. 
Give my love to your dear Mama. I hope I shall here from her soon. Kiss dear Susan one hundred times and except the same number for yourself. 
Good by and God bless you my dear Boy and may He never leave you but may he direct you in all things and keep you from the evils of this wicked world.  That is the sincere prayer, dear Edward of your ever fond and Affectonate 
Aunt Isabella Alice Wyly
PS Joyned by all in kindest love to you exept the same from your fond Aunt
