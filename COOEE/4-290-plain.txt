We have been asked to publish the following extracts from the manifesto of the Labor Conference held in November: - It was arranged that a fighting platform of six points chosen from the old Labor platform should be adopted to make the line of demarcation between those who are struggling for the masses and those who are against them clear and distinct and recognised by all.  The remaining planks of the platform are in no way abandoned, nor is their consideration postponed, but these six are to be the rallying cries of the Labor Party during the forthcoming electoral fight. These six are:
1. Land Value Taxation - Cessation of alienation of Crown lands; tenant right to Crown lessees.
2. Mining on Private Property - No royalties to private owners nor compensation except for damage done.
3. Abolition of the Upper House - Introduction of the Referendum.
4. Local Government on a Democratic basis.
5. National Bank - to secure State control of the National currency; to transact all ordinary banking business.
6. Legislative Limitation of the Working Day to Eight hours. It was also determined by the. Conference that the Labor Party in Parliament should use every means to enforce the full citizen rights of State and municipal employees.
The next Labor Party in Parliament must be active and united. To achieve this it must have singleness of purpose and distinctness of aim. To gain these the Conference has decided (a) That a Parliamentary Labor Party, to be of any weight, must give a solid vote in the House upon all questions affecting the Labor Platform, the fate of the Ministry, or calculated to establish a monopoly or confer further privileges on the already privileged classes as they arise, and (b) that accordingly every candidate who runs in the Labor interest should be required to pledge himself not only to the fighting platform, but also to vote on every occasion specified in Clause A as the majority of the Parliamentary Labor Party may in caucus decide.
This means that only those men will be accepted as Labor candidates who can conscientiously pledge themselves to put the Labor platform before everything else. On all minor questions Labor candidates will be left unbound. Those Labor candidates who are elected on such conditions will form the Parliamentary Labor Party. It will be their business to offer a determined and united opposition to every kind of injurious legislation and Parliamentary trickery, and to struggle for the various reforms included in the Labor platform and essential to the welfare of the whole people.
Whenever question affecting the life of a Government arises, the Labor Party will vote unitedly upon it. They will be guided in such voting entirely by a consideration of how the support or the defeat of the Ministry of the day will affect the passage of the Labor platform into law. The fact that by turning one Ministry out and bringing another in, they may be changing the policy of the country (from so-called Protection to so-called Freetrade, or vice versa), they will disregard.  This is what is meant by sinking the fiscal question. They will not sink the question of revenue. They will strive to obtain revenue for State and local purposes by a tax on unimproved land values, and thus bring into use the bulk of the hand now held by monopolists for speculative purposes. In all other questions of revenue, the Party has a free hand to act in the best interest of the country.
Any man turning from the straight path thus laid down can find no place in the ranks or councils of the Party. He will be distinctly repudiated by all Labor bodies.
These are the programme, platform, and policy of the Labor Party. Electors, will you support the Party? Sink all petty jealousies and unimportant issues. Vote for the Labor League candidate in your electorate, so that Parliament and law may be controlled in the interests, not of a class, but of all.
