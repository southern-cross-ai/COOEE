Hugh has left Craig's and is going up country to a place called Heathcote. He will have Â£2 2s. a week. I see by yours that you have taken a situation as landsteward at a pound a week. If you are found it is very good wages but, if not, it is not worth having. If my health keeps good I expect to have a bit more wages before one twelve month comes round; that is as a coachman.  The sound of coachman will jar in your ears I suppose but servants in this country are never so much looked down on about gentlemen's places as they are at home and you are not obliged to do flunkey so much or touch your hat or say yes mam or yes sir, simply yes or no, I will or I haven't time. If you are civil and obedient is all that is required but they will not have anyone who drinks. I find although my hand was so long out of practice that I can do work as well, and as much of it, as any other man that I ever wrought beside here. I find that although I have not perhaps quite so much physical strength as some I can handicap most of them in quickness. 
 Susanna: you must be very careful and not catch cold again. You must not get overheated. You must not put your hands in cold water. You must not be out in the night air and yous must take outdoor exercise, say weed potatoes when the ground is quite dry but perhaps there would be too much bending over your chest. Drink plenty of warm milk from the cow. Drink nothing else neither water nor tea and it will make you like it better. Be sure and take my advice for I have had experience.
