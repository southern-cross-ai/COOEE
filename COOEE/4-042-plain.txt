Division I has to a large extent escaped this feud, in consequence of the sound tenure under which the lands included were originally occupied; and some small portions of Division II, where nature or circumstance has averted a collision of interests, have been kept out of the circle of discord and chicanery; but, with the exceptions of these fractions, which comprise about one-fiftieth part of the lands of the second Division, the huge area of 86 millions of acres has provided a field on which every form of abuse has been carried out in defiance of the public interest. Division III shows the first signs of the evils which have ravaged Division II; for, there, the public lands are already being spoiled by the lessees in anticipation of the advent of active selection.
It is manifest all through the mass of testimony, that the conservation and beneficial management of the Crown Lands as the heritage of the Colony have been the last matters considered. While the waste of the territory has been disregarded, the law has at one time been interpreted to favour the squatter, at another time to favour the selector; and a spurious claim to credit for even-handed justice is habitually put forward, because the one class has thus been enabled by law to retaliate upon the other the injuries which each has suffered. A whole station is despoiled by the conflict of squatter and selector, and it is argued that the balance is held fairly, if a lawful intrusion on a leasehold by a conditional purchaser can be thwarted or avenged by the use of an improvement purchase or a Volunteer land order. The consequences to the lands so dealt with, as affecting those whose birthright they are, and the generations whose future depends upon them, have been made palpable in a form that cannot admit of doubt.
The study of the maps representing lands in every part of territorial Division II, and extending along the eastern frontier of Division III, will render a verdict as to either the policy or administration of the Act of 1861 unmistakable.
While that Act has professed to open the country to settlement, these maps show that it has supplied with unstinting hand the machinery required to obstruct and injure the settler it created. It has barred the advance of honest enterprise in all directions, and has at the same time opened a door for the entrance of every phase of abuse and fraud, to be shared in by persons of all classes and conditions.
It would be well, if the moral and social evils which have grown from the law could be depicted as vividly as the waste of the national estate has been displayed; but it needs little argument to prove the vice of a policy which of its very essence divides the rural population into two hostile camps; and it would be superfluous to state that the personal virtues of veracity and honorable dealing have been tarnished by the daily habit of intrigue, the practice of evading the law, and by declarations in defiance of fact universally made.  It is in evidence that self-interest has created a laxity of conscience in all matters connected with the Land Law, and that the stain attaches to men of all classes and all degrees.
But the extent to which the essential object of the Act has been carried out, it may be held, is the true test of the policy. On this point there is no direct proof. The Department of Lands contains in its records no statistics bearing upon the actual results in settlement which have accrued from the legislation initiated in 1861. The returns provided by the Conditional Sales Branch indicate the number of applications dealt with in various stages, and the number which, up to a certain date, remain not transferred; but these transactions are not in any way identified with the existence of actual homesteads, or with the occupation of the soil by individuals. The system of inspection adopted of late years is directed merely to the scrutiny of particular cases, but, as a means of verifying positive settlement, is futile.
The general results of the policy can, however, be ascertained with tolerable certainty, in spite of the obscurity which shrouds departmental dealings, but to make the facts apparent will require a good deal more detail than would be necessary if method and lucidity had characterised the administration of the Act.
The return of conditional purchases states the progress of alienation under the Branch as follows: - Since 1861 there have been 170,242 original applications. Of these there have been dealt with, either wholly or partially, 129,8011. The number under the residential clauses, sections 13 and 14, are stated at 62,085 and of these there remained not transferred in December, 1882, 32,795. These 32,795, and a proportion of the 29,290 transferred purchases to be hereafter dealt with, purport to represent existing residential conditional purchases. The question next arises how far these may be taken to represent homestead settlement, It is to be noted, to begin, that of the 32,795, over 11,000 have been taken up since the Act of 1880 came into force. That measure necessitates a residence of five years before transfer can be effected; consequently, till the expiry of that term, no conclusion can be come to as to their integrity in law or the bona fides of the applicants. It is likewise to be borne in mind that prior to the Act of 1875, selection by minors, or on behalf of minors, was largely practised. The children of people living on stations and on selections were made use of universally to secure land. In many districts, from this cause, the actual homesteads number only one-third or one-fourth of the selections upon which all conditions are field to have been fulfilled. Further, before the appointment of inspectors, great numbers of spurious and irregular selections were condoned, and the land passed into the hands of the applicants without either improvement or residence being enforced.  In regard to the 29,290 transferred selections, it must of course be borne in mind that many of the original holders have, when obtaining pecuniary assistance, transferred their selections by way of mortgages, continuing, however, to reside on the land. Many also have sold out to other persons who reside in their stead. The balance - say two-thirds - may be held then to represent the transferred selections unoccupied, or held by pastoral lessees and not used for purpose of residence.
The general result has been that a great proportion of the selections taken up before 1875 were confirmed and became private property without in any way representing settlement; and as to those taken up since May, 1880, the question of residence has not yet arisen, but it is generally believed that only a small proportion will take the form of homesteads.
The Census returns again supply no direct evidence as to the number of conditional purchasers who are permanent settlers on the soil. They contain no enumeration of selectors as such, and the electoral rolls are equally indefinite. In both, all alienees of land from the Crown and owners of freehold property appear classed together as freeholders without distinction. The facts about selection have been apparently considered things that it did not concern the public to know; but an approximation to these facts may be reached through an analysis of the tabulated figures detailing the distribution of landed estate furnished by the Registrar-General. As more effective for the purpose of this Report, the figures are now presented, apportioned according to the three Territorial Divisions adopted. 
This estimate is not inconsistent with the departmental returns. The difference is met by a fair allowance for minors' selections, aggregated holdings of two or more purchases under the 13th or 14th clause, selections acquired where conditions have not been fulfilled, holdings transferred to pastoral lessees and not resided upon, other unoccupied selections, purchases the title to which is now pending (for there can be little doubt that when the five years' period for residence, and improvement in regard to selections applied for under the Act of 1880 falls in, another deduction will be made for voidings, forfeitures, and transfers), and occupied areas the titles to which were acquired under clauses of the Act other than those relating to conditional sale. In all probability the selections held as homesteads according to the intent of the law do not equal 20,000 or indeed 18,000.
Had it been possible, a correct account of the resident conditional purchasers in a few of the electorates would have been taken as a test of the accuracy of the returns, but time would not permit this to be done. Only one accurate return of this character has been obtained, and that is from the Surveyors' District of Deniliquin. In that district, 1,424 residential selectors purchased 558,705 acres, but now only 244 remain, who own about 200,000 acres. Of these, 115 own 500 sheep and upwards and about 190,000 acres of land, the remaining 10,000 acres being held by 129 persons. Within the electorate of Murray, which comprises the Surveyors' District of Deniliquin and also large adjoining areas, 2,100 selectors became possessed (to the satisfaction of the Lands Department) of residential homesteads, and, although it is notorious that there are many other freeholders residing on purchased land therein, such for instance as improvement areas used for squatting homesteads and out-stations, the Registrar-General's return gives but 590 as the number of free-holders who remain in occupation. This tallies with the result of local observation.
The distribution of landed property in the three Territorial divisions, as shown above, is well worthy of study, as illustrating different phases of the land question. Division I is less than one third of the area of Division II, besides consisting of much poorer country; yet, owing to the sound principles upon which its colonization was originally based, it has escaped all the greater evils of the class contest which has pervaded the rest of the Colony.  The figures quoted show that nearly one-half of the settlement of New South Wales has taken place within this narrow tract, and moreover, this settlement is known to be of a far sounder, more permanent, and less speculative character than in Division II. Division I actually contains more properties of from 40 acres to 1,000 than Division II, and, relatively to the acreage, double the proportion of estates from 1,000 acres to 40,000. There is also a vast difference in the character of these larger holdings in the two Divisions, in Division I the 925 estates of from 1,000 to 40,000 acres are mostly genuine family homesteads, such as are to be seen in the Roxburgh map. In Division II many of the 1,728 so-called estates are not estates at all, but are simply made up of scattered portions such as appear on the maps Gwydir 2 and Clarence 1 - runs "peacocked" to keep off selectors.
But if Division II fails so signally in the number of small and moderate-sized properties for its acreage, it monopolizes all the distinction to be gained from the number of its great estates. The eighty estates recorded as being over 40,000 acres ate mainly in Riverina, and some of them contain more than 200,000 acres of freehold land.
The success of settlement in a tract of country so poor and so limited, as contrasted with its failure in a territory so much richer and more extensive, tells little in favour of free selection on pastoral leaseholds. Division I has produced general family settlement; Division II has produced eighty huge estates up to 300,000 acres from which human habitation has been all but obliterated.
Though the Census of 1881, as has been already remarked, takes no note of the results of the law of 1861, still it throws a light on the question of settlement which more than confirms the conclusions arrived at from Departmental and Statistical Returns. It shows clearly that the increase of the rural population is approaching stagnation, and that there must be thousands of selections taken up yearly which represent no settlement whatever.
The diagram illustrating the comparative increase of town and country population, constructed by scale, from figures compiled under the responsibility of the Registrar-General, cannot be studied too closely, the accuracy of the facts it discloses being unquestionable. If in connection with this diagram an analysis is made of the figures contained in tabular return No. 2, it will be found that, during the first decennial period (1862-1871) of the operation of the Land Laws, approved residential conditional purchases bore the proportion of 23 per centum to the increased rural population, whereas during the second term (1872-1881) that proportion increased to 81 per centum. Again, taking another view of the question, we find that during the 1862-1871 period, for each individual member of the rural increase an area of 27 acres was conditionally purchased, whilst for the 1872-1881 term no less than 236 acres were selected. 
If the increased population of 1862-1871, numbering 78,097, was due to occupation by conditional purchase, and might fairly be considered as representing family settlement, the same proportion of occupation to selection should have resulted in an increase of 168,126 persons during the 1872-1881 period, instead of 47,433, the actual increase. There is reason in reality to believe that even this trifling extra-urban increase of the past ten years is as much caused by railway works and the opening of new mines as by the settlement of population employed in either pastoral or agricultural operations. So that, if free selection before survey is to be accepted as the principal factor in or inducement to permanent rural settlement in this Colony, it must be evident that it has signally failed. The accompanying table illustrates in a striking manner the facts we have endeavoured to delineate: - 
The proofs which have been submitted of the waste of territory and the failure of settlement are enough to condemn the existing policy, but an inquiry into the state of the public lands and the operation of the law would not be complete that did not deal also with the technical construction of the Acts and the method of their administration.
Ambiguity in intent, as well as in expression, has been a marked characteristic of all Land legislation since 1861. Litigation, wasteful cost and delay, arising from this cause, have injuriously affected numbers of persons. The special interpretation of some term, susceptible of two different meanings, has led to lives being wasted and properties eaten up with legal expenses; and lawyers of eminence have condemned in no measured terms statutes which they considered equally pernicious in their intent, imperfect in their construction, and ambiguous in their wording. The history of the 31st clause is an instance of law-making in this Colony which should not pass unnoticed in this inquiry.
In addition to the defective construction of the various Land Acts, the large permissive powers always appended have involved a most unnecessary and pernicious exercise of ministerial discretion.  It is possible that there may be communities elsewhere to which the exercise of ministerial discretion may be an advantage, but the effect in New South Wales, through the endless diversity of interpretations and misinterpretations for years, has been to annul the value of the law altogether. The plain meaning of any existing Act is now of less weight than the caprice or bias of the Minister, and it is notorious that the most effective mode of getting business done at the "Lands," whether in terms of the law, or with the view of thwarting its operation, is to select a land agent who is a member of the popular branch of the Legislature.
The extent to which the Colony suffers from the centralized system of administration is second only to the evils which have grown from the vicious policy of the land law. Delay, accumulation of arrears of work, individual loss, the daily growth of the official staff, are all most needlessly occasioned by carrying the details of transactions to headquarters, which might be much more easily and accurately completed in the districts where they arise. To give full proof of the utter folly of our centralized method, it is not necessary to go beyond the limits of the Colony itself; but if the dealings of the kindred communities of the group are looked into, then the contrast would not for a moment stand the light of day.
In the course of the inquiry, the want of one fixed unit bf division for the Colony has greatly added to the difficulty of presenting many matters in an intelligible form. Counties, land office districts, survey districts, pastoral districts, stock inspectors' districts, police, census, electoral and licensing districts, have all been arranged without any attempt at harmony, and, irrespective of general practical results: In considering an amended system, the advantages of establishing one invariable standard of division, such as the county, should not be lost sight of.
Throughout the inquiry every effort has been made to ascertain the extent of land which, used according to proved methods, would yield a fair independent livelihood to a working family. It is assumed in the first place that the most eligible spots, possessing exceptional fertility or value from position, are to be reserved as agricultural and village areas, and that this question applies simply to the average bush country - the ordinary pastoral land. The evidence shows that in Division II a general uniformity of opinion holds that four selections, or 2,560 acres, will be necessary to form a homestead capable of supporting a family by the combination of the only industries practicable - namely, keeping sheep or other live stock and cultivation. In Division III, the country being generally waterless and the rainfall uncertain, an extent of nine sections, of a farm of 5,760 acres, is considered the smallest area that would enable such a family to make an independent living. In Division I, the available land being largely disposed of, and much of the surface remaining being very inferior in character, it is stated that a portion of land fit for any use could not now be got larger than two sections, or 1,280 acres. 
It is doubtful if this extent of third-class land or mountain country would by itself be worth occupying. Still, a leasehold of that character, granted under condition of fencing, might be a good addition to an ordinary selection. Moreover, much of this Division is almost of a suburban character, and it is known that even the most rugged ranges acquire a value near the centres of traffic. The substitution of a more permanent tenure for the existing pre-lease is advocated with the view of bringing the inferior lands of this Division under more beneficial occupation; and the evidence put forward in respect to the occupation of the Church and School Lands is conclusive as to the value of second and third class grazing lands under a secure tenure.
Consideration has been given to the policy of keeping survey ahead of settlement, in contra-distinction to the existing method of selection before survey. By Return No. 3 in the Appendix, it is shown that during a period of five years, from 1878 to 1882 inclusive, in nineteen land districts, conditional purchases to the number of 2,155 were void, and that the applicants were not informed of the invalidity for an average period after application of eight and a half months. The delay, loss, and disappointment arising from this cause must have been very great over the whole Colony, during the full term of the Act's operation, if five years within a small area entailed the voiding of 2,000 conditional purchases. Of a total of 1,827 selections void in the year 1881, 1,232 became invalid from errors that would have been prevented by previous survey. If settlement has been checked to the extent indicated by these figures, then a grave indictment may be preferred against the present method. As to the relative cost, the testimony of qualified witnesses is invariable to the effect that a general survey ahead of settlement would cost not more than one-fourth of the expense entailed by the measuring of separate selections, while the superior advantages of security of title, with immediate and certain possession, would be comparatively incalculable. As indicating the amount of inconvenience and loss which has , though the want of a preliminary survey, fallen upon conditional purchasers it is to be remarked that since 1861 three separate validating Bills have been passed for the relief of persons who had used the light of selection, on reserves and other lands not open to alienation.
