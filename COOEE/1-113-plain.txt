Government House,
Sydney,
New South Wales,
30 April, 1808.
MY LORD,
Mr Campbell, Mr Palmer, Mr Arndell, and Mr Williamson retired to dine with me some time after five o'clock. About sunset we heard that Mr McArthur was liberated from the gaol by Major Johnston's order in writing as follows: - 'To the keeper of His Majesty's gaol at Sydney.
'You are hereby required and directed immediately to deliver into the custody of Garnham Blaxwell and Nicholas Bayly, Esqrs., the body of John McArthur, Esq., who was committed by warrant, dated the 25th inst., signed by Richard Atkins, Thomas Amdell, Robert Campbell, and John Palmer, Esquires...

Without ceremony they broke into all parts of the house (even into the ladies' room) and arrested all the magistrates: Mr Gore, Provost Marshal, Mr Fulton, the clergyman, and Mr Griffin, my secretary.  Thus the civil power was annihilated, and the colony in the hands of the military, guided by McArthur and Bayly. Nothing but calamity upon calamity was to be expected, even massacre and secret murder.
I had only just time to retire upstairs to prevent giving myself up, and to see if anything could be done for the restoration of my authority; but they soon found me in a back room, and a daring set of ruffians under arms intoxicated by spirituous liquors, which was given them for the purpose, and threatening to plunge their bayonets into me if I resisted, seized me. I was now obliged to go below, where I found the rooms filled with soldiers, and presently Lieutenant Moore came forward and presented me with a letter from Major Johnston, a copy of which follows: - 'Head-quarters, 26 January 1808.
