 we have started a young man's mutual improvement society in connection with the church in which I am a member, also a committee man. This was one of the nights of the meeting and a lecture was rendered by a Mr. Morrow, one of the vice presidents and a North of Ireland man. In fact there were several north of Ireland people in it. The lecture was on gossip or Mrs. Grundy and her friends. It was very good and very instructive and one that any person could advise from. I am forgetting myself; this is not interesting to you.
