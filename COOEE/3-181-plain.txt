Flies - black, blue, bumble, and blow - musquitoes, cockroaches, spiders, tarantulas, and even centipedes, annoy and terrify the new arrival. The musquito is a beast. It comes buzzing against your cheek, with a drowsy singsong whir, fixes its suckers into the flesh, and bounds off with another song - a kind of carmen triumphale - leaving a large red mark behind it, which is far more irritating than a healing blister. While I am writing this little book, our ship is in the neighbourhood of Cape Horn, and my hands and feet are covered with chilblains. Still, I can safely say, never did chilblain - in its frostiest and most abandoned form - vex like the bite of a well-trained and experienced musquito. They use in the colony what are called musquito curtains; but so far from these keeping away the insects, I never found them of any other use than in imprisoning the little fiends who had sneaked in during the process of bed-making. Some nights they have driven me almost mad, forced me out of bed, and compelled me to dress myself, even to the putting on of gloves, in order to protect my skin. They have a great relish - being epicures in their way - for the round, fat, mottled part of the hand ridging the off-side of the palm. In about two seconds one will sow it with bumps and blisters from the wrist to the little finger. Strange as it may read, I used to let my beard grow in order that I might rub this part of my hand against my serried chin, and thus allay the irritation. If I slept in gloves, they punished my legs; if I slept in stockings, they riddled my hands; if I tried both, they punctured the edges of my ears.  The walls of my bedroom were stencilled with their corpses; for whenever I was driven from the sheets, I used to go round with a slipper and - with intense satisfaction - settle hundreds of them as they stood stropping their stings upon the wall. They, too, especially hate and harass the new-chum.
Having thus given an outline - somewhat hard and dry, I am afraid - of the everyday doings and ordinary aspects of Australia, let me here frame the coup d'oeil with one or two little bits of description calculated to convey an idea of the natural beauties and peculiarities of the country. Australia is not the level and unvaried waste that some have represented: its trees are not all gums, its flowers are not all scentless. I have gathered posies in the wild bush which, for beauty and perfume, would have delighted the most fastidious lounger at Chiswick. I have seen twenty different kinds of trees of twenty various shades of foliage, growing naturally in the space of about an acre; I have walked through rich and ever-changing scenes - verdant valleys, zoned with blue-capped hills - and, but for the somewhat dusty foliage, the ring of the cicada, the guffaw of the laughing jackass, or the rattle of the snake, might have imagined myself in the fairest and fairyest spots of the Mother land.
The evenings in Australia are singularly beautiful. I have often read a newspaper by the light of the moon. The stars are very white and large, and seem to drop pendulous from the blue, like silver lamps from a dome of calaite. I used to visit a house a long way out of Sydney, for the pleasure of being lighted home by the stars. Generally, I did not admire the Australian climate - its sudden changes, occasionally of thirty or forty degrees in two or three hours, its clouds of dust, its awful storms, and its hot winds; but an Australian evening - especially in winter - in its serene loveliness, defies all attempts at description. I have looked from my little study window sometimes at midnight, and seen the harbour so brightly argent with the moon, that it seemed as though He had walked again upon the sea, and left the glory of His footsteps on the water.
Having mentioned, in passing, a hot wind, let me endeavour to convey some notion of what a hot wind really is. It is early morning, and as you look from your window, in the suburbs of Sydney, you see a thin white vapour rising from the far-off bush. The sheep out there in the distance are congregated beneath the trees, while the old cows are standing knee-deep in those clayey creeks of water that trickle from the headed-up rocks above.  You have seen all this before, and know too well what it means. Before breakfast time, there will "be" a hot wind.
It comes. The white earth cracks as it passes over it, as though it were a globe of crystal struck by some invisible and mighty hand. The air is hot and murky, as the breath from an oven; and you see trees wither - the fruit shrivel and drop from the vines - as though the Last Seal were opened, and the breath of the Destroying Angel had gone forth. The cicadas seem to shriek (their shrill note is always shrillest in hot weather), and the birds drop dead from the trees. The dogs in the street lie down and hide their dry protruding tongues in the dust. Higher and higher rises the mercury in the glass, until now, at noon, it stands at 147Â°! You stop up every keyhole and crevice in your room to keep out the burning Sirocco, and endeavour, perhaps, to read. In a minute stars dance before your eyes, and your temples throb like pulses of hot iron. You allow the book to fall from your hands, and strive to drop to sleep. It is not much relief if you succeed, for you are safe to dream of the Inferno or Beckford's Hall of Eblis. There is only one thing you can do that gives relief. Light your pipe, mix your sherry-cobbler, and smoke and drink until the change arrives.
The "Southerly Buster", as this change is called, generally comes - sounding on,
Like the storm-wind from Labrador,
The wind Euroclydon,
early in the evening. A cloud of dust - they call it, in Sydney, a "brickfielder" - thicker than any London fog, heralds its approach, and moves like a compact wall across the country. In a minute the temperature will sink fifty or sixty degrees, and so keenly does the sudden change affect the system, that hot toddy takes the place of the sherry-cobbler, and your great-coat is buttoned tightly around you until a fire can be lighted. Now, if you look from your window in the direction where you saw that white vapour ascending in the morning, a spectacle terrible in its magnificence will meet your eye. For miles around - as far as the gaze can reach - bush fires are blazing. You see the trail of the flame extending into the interior until it grows faint and thin along the hilltops, as though a wounded deer had moved, bleeding, upon the road. Nearer, however, the sight is grand and awful, and hints of the Final Apocalypse when the stars shall fall like those charred branches that drop with a thundrous crash and scatter a cloud of glowing embers around them.
No matter where you live in Sydney, looking from your window across the harbour into the surrounding bush, you can always see sights like this after a hot wind. The reflection upon the water itself is very fine.  The emerald changes into ruby - the water into wine. The white sails of boats become of "purple" and "their prows of beaten gold". Everything seems bathed in an atmosphere of romance, and, if the impression were not lowered by the idea, the sheets of flame in the distance might be taken for the crimson walls of Aladdin's palace gleaming through the woods.
Sometimes these hot winds last for two or three days, and then the effects are something lamentable. Scarcely a blade of vegetation is left in the ground - the sere leaves fall from the trees as in a blast of autumn. The same week that I landed in Sydney, a hot wind lasted for four days, on the last of which no less than thirty persons dropped dead in the streets. I remember I had a little garden to my house, and the white-starred jessamine was in full flower in front of the lower windows. Before the wind was over nothing remained but a bunch of dry sticks, kept to the wall by the pieces of cloth with which they were fastened. But I have witnessed other phenomena in Australia as remarkable - if not as terrible - as a hot wind, and I must therefore pass on.
Soon after my arrival in New South Wales, I went up the Paterson, a charming river watering some of the richest soil in the country. While here I saw that beautiful phenomenon, known as the Aurora Australis. Imagine, reader, an arch of palest gold built right across the heavens, and set along the top with rows of Gothic spear-like points, suffused with violet and tipped with burning crimson. Imagine further these lambent spears darting out a thousand varied coruscations until every tree around glows like the bush of Horeb, and the tops of the distant mountains flush with a pale uncertain consecration. Imagine, now, that the arch is first splitting into purple gaps, and now falling into molten fragments, mixed with a rain of many coloured stars - that the night is moonless, and all without the influence of the palpitating light as dark and sullen as the blasted strand of Erebus - imagine all this, and you will have a limning, faint and feeble enough, of one phase in the luminous existence of the Aurora Australis.
A leaf or two from my Up-Country Note Book, will not come in amiss here:
Monday
Nothing but gums and three-rail fences. Flies and parrots in abundance. Saw a flock of at least 500 paroquets, chased by a hawk. He caught one, and not being able to kill it on the wing, darted down to a gully, and held his little victim beneath the water until it was drowned.
Tuesday
Scenery improved. Fine dark hills clothed with verdure. At night I witnessed a "corroboree".  About twenty naked blacks, painted hideously, with blue stripes along each rib and down each leg - white around each eye, and splashes of red upon the forehead - were dancing beneath the moon, and grunting all the while with a husky hooh! - hooh! - hooh! so as to keep a very common time. Five or six "gins", one with a little boy upon her back, were sprawled upon the ground, tomtoming on opossum rags, piling the fires with fresh logs, and occasionally breaking in with a wild chorus of
Corinda briar,
Corinda briarre!
prolonging the last syllable for nearly half a minute. Catlin would have given a little for the picture.
Wednesday
(I extract two brief paragraphs from a lengthy passage.) - A single fork of lightning struck the brow of a colossal rock rising from the waters along which we journeyed. A boom of thunder - low, rumbling, and long-continued - just wrinkled the face of the stream, and one or two large gouts of rain fell with a heavy plash upon the beach. There was a smell of balm wafted for a moment across the air. The atmosphere flushed suddenly to a pale lilac, and the water slept beneath its weight of lilies. The white leaves lay upon its surface like flakes of snow.
Fair prelude to the coming storm! In half an hour, black huddled clouds came sweeping up the sky, and presently stream upon stream of lightning (no other words will convey what I mean) began to pour down, until the air seemed saturated with the sulphurous vapour. The thunder appeared to shake the rocks, and the rain came upon us like a perfect deluge. It fell in water-spouts rather than drops, and we had to use our hats to bale the boat out. All nature seemed convulsed. Deep shadows moved upon the hills, and we could see the tallest trees upon their sides struck down, or rent in twain, by the half-blinding lightning. The storm, however, did not last long. In an hour the air was as clear as ever, and flocks of black wild-duck rose out of the cool reedy fens where they had taken protection, and went careering, with a hearty caw-caw, after their leader up the stream.
