I have been at death door in Queensland twice with the fever but thank God I pulled through, but it was touch and go with me the last time for when I got over the fever I had no money and I was among strangers, and far away back in Queensland and as weak as a child, so it was pretty hard lines but I thank God I pulled through. I left Queensland soon after and came to New South Wales. A man, an old mate of mine, paid my way down to Sydney, and from there up the country 300 miles and we both got work on a new railway that was a making. So, dear mother, things were so bad I did not care about writing as I had no good news to send but I hope that the will soon take a change for the better.
