I dined with His Honor a few days ago, and he expressed great satisfaction with the Beer from the Port Dalrymple Brewery. He and Mrs. Arthur and Family are now here at Launceston for six weeks; he has been twice down at my concern, and has promised me every support. He is very much pleased with this side of the Island, and means to spend five or six months here every year.
Great Improvements are going on; a new Church, Court House, Mill, and several other public Buildings; and the Town encreases so fast that I am sure it is nearly twice as large as when I first saw it, and there is nothing but new Houses building wherever you turn your eye. It must in a very few Years become a place of very great importance indeed.
We have had rather an unfavourable season for vegetation, in consequence of a long Drought, and the corn crops are expected to be short in consequence. There is now a market in the Brazils and the Ile of France for all our surplus produce, which has stimulated many of the small as well as principal Farmers to exert themselves. Some of our first rate Settlers live like Nabobs; they have their 5000, 6000 or even 8000 acres of Land, with a good House & building, horned Cattle, sheep, &c, almost innumerable.  The Country is fast filling up, and, unless some new districts are discovered, there will be a scarcity of Land. I still retain the 2000 acres for you; but I shall not press you to come out, as I mentioned to you that I would not. It certainly is the Land of my adoption; still, if things go on well with me for three years, as it is now likely, I mean to take a trip Home for a short time. But it will certainly be to return here.
Should any of my Friends (particularly my very kind Friend Orford) accuse me of neglecting them, assure them to the contrary, and I hope to make op for all very soon. My Ideas are so taken up with my business that it is even at present almost painful to sit down to write to you.
