Judge's Chambers,
Brisbane, Oct. 21st, 1896.
Sir, - 
I have the honour to acknowledge your letter of Oct. 3rd inviting me to attend the proposed People's Federal Convention, to be held at Bathurst, on Nov. 16th, as the guest of the Committee, and to take part in the proceedings of the Convention.
It affords me much regret to be unable to accept the invitation, which I regard as a very great honour, but although I cannot be personally present I shall hope to be favoured with detailed reports of the proceedings, which I shall watch with the greatest interest.
I am very glad to observe that there is every prospect of the Convention being largely attended, and by persons who take an enthusiastic and intelligent interest in the matters of Federation.
I am satisfied that as soon as the people of Australia have a clear and intelligent grasp of the subject the establishment of a Federal Government will not long be delayed, and I look to the coming Convention to do good work in the direction of educating them to this end.
I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient Servant,
S. W. GRIFFITH.
T. A. Machattie, Esq., M.B., President People's Federal Convention.
