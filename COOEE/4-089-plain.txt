 For my own experience I like the country full as well as I expected to - indeed quite a different thing to the time I was in England. Although the Irish are always hard spoken of everywhere, I find that an Irishman takes as well with the people generally as any other countryman. One great thing is never try to hide it; I never do. Everybody is friendly with the new chums as we are called when we come out first. It is a bit different to England where everybody is English. Here you meet people from every part, of course more English than anything else
