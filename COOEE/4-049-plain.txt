Of course it will seem strange to me at first to have no shops etc. but I will soon be used to that. It is a good thing I have not been brought up with dainty ways for it would be a very strange change to one who has been used to life with only its easy and delicate side. You see, if we do not make a very nice and pleasant home there, don't you think we will as time goes on? It will be very awkward to bring furniture so far, it would need to be very carefully packed. You make your mind quite easy about the furnishing of our home, it will please me just the very way my Alick has it, and I do not expect to see in it what you would have if you lived near a town, so don't please trouble yourself that you do not think Lillie will like this or be satisfied with that, just because it is bush fashion.
