My dear Sister 
I received your long looked for letter dated Augt 10th. I was almost begining to think you had forgotten me. You say you wrote to me acnolidging the Pin. I never received it, I was quite ancious untill I herd. 
I was very sorry to hear of your loss but I trust it was your dear mothers gain.  It is a world of sepparation but there is one consolation. We may get to that world where parting is not known. Do you intend to keep on the Business, or ar you in Partnership with Mrs Prescot. I hope you will get on well. I know it will not be for want of exertion on your part. 
I soppose dear Susin will soon be able to help you but it would be a pitty to take her from school as long as you could. I am so glad to hear dear Edward is getting on so well. I trust he will be a comfort to you. Give my kind love to him & tell him I shall write to him nex time as I have left this within a few hours of mail time. I hope he has got my last by this time, as I sent half of my promised present to him and also our likeneses which did not please me. I should have had them taken again only we had not time. I hope you will see they originals some day which you will say then that they did not flatter my dear William and they say I was not flattered either. 
Give my love to Uncle John & family. I am lookin out for a leter from them soon. I soppose Uncle told you that he Met Mr. Gault that is William Partners Brother and his full cosin. There ar 2 of his Brothers living in Manchester. I expect if you ar going there to purchase goods you will meet with them. One of them knows dear Thomas very well also Uncle Johns sons. I was so Glad to hear they new some of my friends. They wrote to that affect to their Brother Robert Gault but after all there ar none of them like my dear husband. You will say & so I say but more than me can testify the same. I must tell you I am as happy as ever in our dear little cottage. I should so like you coul to come to see us, and Judge for yourself. There would be such a resepcion for you from a thorough out & out Irish heart. 
I have had a serious Illness since I wrote to you last. I soppose you will gess what it was, when I tell you I had a Nurse & Doctor &c you may imagine what it was, but thank God I am quite well again. I have much to be thankful for. Hilth & Strength, happins. 
Poor Uncle has been very Poorly indeed. He had an Apses  on his Back which had to be cut out which gave him much pain. I am afraid his constution is completely broaken. Poor fellow I feel so sorry for him but thank God he is now better again & able to go to busines again. Fanny is still going to School & all they others except Robert & they youngest. Robert has left the drapery busin & is learning to be an Architect and is only getting 10 / per week and he got 15 / - and his food in the drapery Shop which mak a deel of difference in the week. 
Ruth sends her kind love to you. She is quite well & has 2 little ones and the 3d expectd. She is quite a little mother. Aunt said she would enclose a line with this but she has not sent it so I soppose I may send her love to you also all they family. She will tell you all the newes of her family that I have left out. 
Do you evr hear anny News of Poor Aunt Lucy. I shoul so like to hear from her. Dear William was so pleased to Get a paper from dear Edward. I should so like Edward would write to him. He would be very pleased. 
Have you seen any thing of the revival of religin that is going on in Belfast. It seams to me as if all the North was in a confusion. I hope it is for we want to see the land of our birth converted to God & Perticully the dark benighted parts of it. I have made up my mind that the King is about to comfort the hole world for it seams as if he was passing out his Spirit upon all Plases & all Churches. 
We have had a sad loss in loosing one of our dear devoted Ministers the one that Married us. He was a dear priest of mine one who always took an intrest in me a priest like a father but he is gon to heaven & who could wish him back. All I can say is, may my end be like his. He preached 3 times the Sundy before he died, twice in Chapel and once in the open air. He was very impressive. He had a litle cold then but he did not mind that but it brought on fever which caused his death in 5 days. He has left a wife & 2 Children to deplore his loss. She is a dear Christian. She can with all confidence say thy will be done. Nealy all the congregation was in morning and a Minster of almost all denominations were at His funeral what got up with our respect. 
I inclose a him  he sang with his little Girls hand in his 12 hours before he died & and almost out of his mind. He did go quite out of his mind before he died. I think you will say I am wandering from subject to subject but I was so fond of him I cannot but tell you of him. 
I hope I wont tire your patience with this scrible as usual. Write soon & tell me all the newse. Give my kind love to Mrs. Prescot. I soppose she cannot remember me. Kiss the dear Children for me. 
Dear William & his Sister Unites with me and dear love to you. 
Believe me dear Sister your ever fond & Affectionate Sister 
Isabella Alice Scott 
Write soon. Excuse haste.
