We never go a couple of hundred yards from the hut without our revolvers or a gun. I am the farthest back, most remote from civilisation in Western Australia. It is about 80 miles to my nearest neighbour in one direction, that is north west. South west it is 68 miles, east a couple of thousand, and south about 800, so I am pretty well isolated. I have nine white men on the station and about 20 niggers, some I only keep and feed to keep them from killing the sheep.  They are the most primitive lot I have seen. They wear no dress nor covering of any kind. Some of the men have a string tied round their waist to stick their boomerang or Corvak in and some a string round their foreheads through which they stick kangaroo bones as ornaments. They are good natured among themselves and share all their food in common. They will never eat anything if there are others about without sharing it, sometimes giving it all away and going without himself. They have no religion nor idea of God they are afraid of an evil spirit they called Gingie and they have long flat pieces of wood with a hole at one end for a string this they whirl round their head and it makes a curious moaning sound and they think it keeps off the Gingie.
The women are not allowed to see them; if they do and a man gets to know about it he will kill her. Some odd times they indulge in cannibalism, but not often, and they only eat black fellows that's one consolation.
