My Dear Wallop and Lottie,
Ever since you drove away yesterday you have been hardly out of my mind and it was a grief to say "Goodbye" & when I saw Harrie with her companions meet you & cheer as you passed the gate I had to swallow a lump. Your visit has been very pleasant & grateful to us. We miss you! I don't like to look at your room as I pass. I can hardly believe that you have been with us & gone. It's all so like a dreand Bless you both - I hope you had a quiet passage over last night. It was very peaceful here, hardly any wind. What is your address in Sydney? Harrie & I hope to meet you on the 16th... I can't write any more. the house is dull. but we all miss you & wish you back with our very fond love to you both.
I am affectionately yours
Tho. Reibey.
