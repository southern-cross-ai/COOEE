The secretary (Mr. Temple) reported that there were forty names on the roll, and when all returns were in from the enrolling representatives, he estimated that there would be considerably over 100 members. A strong feeling was entertained at the meeting, and it was decided to form the union with the following objects: - 
1. To protect the rights and privileges of shearers throughout Australasia. 2. To secure a fair rate of wages by the adoption of prices suitable to the circumstances of the several colonies and districts. 3. The adoption of just and equitable agreements between employers and employs. 4. To make such arrangements as will prevent undue loss of time in travelling to sheds, and to ensure the carrying out of agreements made by shearers with sheep-owners.
5. To protect members against exorbitant prices for rations. The initiation fee was fixed at 2s. 6d. Mr. Temple was elected secretary, and a provisional committee of nine members was elected, with Mr. W. G. Spence as chairman. The committee meet to-night at Fern's hotel, at eight o'clock, to adopt rules, &c.
