Sydney, 10th September, 1839.
Port Phillip.
Her Majesty the Queen having been pleased to command that Charles Joseph La Trobe, Esquire, shall be appointed Superintendent of the Settlement and District of Port Phillip, His Excellency the Governor directs it to be notified that a Commission containing such Appointment has been issued accordingly, under the Great Seal of the Territory, and the prescribed Oaths have been this day administered to his Honour in the presence of the Governor and the Executive Council.
The District of Port Phillip will comprise that portion of the Territory of New South Wales which lies to the south of the thirty-sixth degree of south latitude, and betwen the one hundred and forty-first and one hundred and forty-sixth degree of east longitude; within those limits his Honor the Superintendent will exercise the powers of a Lieutenant Governor, and all Officers of the Government and others are hereby required to render him obedience and respect accordingly.
His Excellency cannot allow Captain Lonsdale to be relieved from the duties with which he has been hitherto charged, as the chief organ of the Government at Port Phillip, without availing himself of the opportunity to express publicly the sense he entertains of the ability, zeal, and success with which that Officer has performed those duties, and labored to develope the resources of that important Settlement, under the peculiar difficulties attending its first formation and very rapid progress. 
The services of Captain Lonsdale, however, will still be retained to the Government and the Public in his capacity of Police Magistrate for the Town and District of Melbourne.
By His Excellency's Command,
E. DEAS THOMSON.
