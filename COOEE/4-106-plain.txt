 I have observed by several of your last letters that there is very little coin to be made at home. Indeed I am surprised that people in health and strength should stick so closely to the old country. Had I the health and strength of some people I believe I could make a very good living but unhappily I am never sure of having permanent good health. At present I had to give up my situation owing to not being strong enough to hold out, but indeed I had two good reasons that is very hard work and bad tack (food). I have determined on taking a couple or three weeks spell I intend employing my leisure at painting the roofs of our hives and making a few section trays. I have to make a hive for a man for which I will get 32s. 6d. 
My partner Amey has absconded, nobody knows where. He left me to pay both my own and his share of some accounts which was against us and also took with him over £10 in cash. I am very glad to be rid of him and although he has taken a slant at me, yet he left me the art of beekeeping which I will be able to use to advantage. 
We purpose holding on the very few stocks of bees which we possess and increasing their number next spring and going into a heavily timbered district which is the best for bee culture. The is nothing which yields so much honey in this country as the gum trees (eucalyptus). The bees in this country depend more on the blossom of the trees than on the field flowers as clover and other good honey plants do not thrive in every district, yet they thrive very well and even better than at home in some portions of Gippsland. Gippsland is a great agricultural district. There is always a good and bad honey year alternatively; this is the bad year.  Some of our stocks have over 70£bs. Of honey stored notwithstanding so that gives encouragement. There is one stock in particular which has 16 two pound sections but all filled. I believe if we had 200 hives we could make £600 a year  
Susie speaks of bad times and difficulty of making anything at home. Indeed I am surprised at people grumbling about hard times. What would the times be if like Hugh or I with no home and without capital? But the answer is people at home cannot make the money at home they can in Australia. Why then complain? There is many lines of splendid steamers plying between Australia and home? Whose blame is it if home people with means to alter it, cannot live as well as people on this side of the globe? The want of courage to face 13,000 miles of sea. The want of courage to depend upon the sweat of their own brow. These are part of the reason of people enduring and putting up with difficulties. They starve lest they should starve. They think it is better to starve in Ireland than to run the risk of starving in Australia. They prefer half loaf and idleness to work and plenty of bread. 
Everybody who comes here without a capital has to work or the will starve or run the risk for Australians will not keep idlers. The only way to get out of it is to get into jail which is not a hard job. The most of the loafers spend most of their time there and the other part stealing. Some end the debate on starving or working by throwing themselves into the Yarra. But this is bad logic.

The above is better. I would prefer hard work any day to the Yarra
