We both abhor that combined hypocrite - 'good society'. The successful stock and share gambler, the fortunate commercial speculator, and that immaculate trades-unionist, the lawyer, are the constituent elements of the bon ton, and they refuse you the right to associate with them, notwithstanding Sir Henry's political entity. And why? Because you had the courage to do openly what hundreds of them have done, and are doing, by stealth, and the great redeeming point in your husband's character is his utter contempt for the society that ignores the woman who has loved him so fearlessly.
Your sympathies are said to be with the women workers of this and all other countries. Why don't you step into the breach that is waiting agape for women leaders; and, irrespective of caste or creed, help to ameliorate the condition of your sisters in the factory and ill-paid worker's home. Such action might bring abuse from the well-to-do; they would, as a matter of duty to their class, be compelled to rail against you, but you owe them no consideration. How have they treated you? Cast away from you, as your husband has done, the vale of fear, and mantle yourself in the garb of determination. The oppressed are waiting for leaders. The beacon fires are burning; it only wants some prominent, courageous women to lead, and victory - woman's social and political emancipation - is theirs and yours. 
Your suffering through social injustice should be enough to spur you on to help to alter the conditions of society, so that your children, and the children of other wronged women, should not suffer the same humiliation at the hands of an immoral self-created aristocracy. The daughters of a high police official are allowed to dance at midnight in the street, and yet are not ostracised from that society which compels you to absent yourself from its luxurious and mocking delirium...
