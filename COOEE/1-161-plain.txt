My dear Mrs. Stokes,
I always willingly obey my Mother when she requests me to write to you, for I know that the goodness of your heart makes you interested with all our welfare, and that a few lines from any of us will not be unwelcomely received. I am happy to inform you that the box, which was retained so long in England arrived safe, some of the things (except the lilac silk) were in the least damaged. How much does your kindness my dear Madam make us all indebted to you, for have we not individually received tokens of remembrance from you.  My Mother says that you are still the same good Mrs. Stokes you were, as when she first knew you, & that she has now for more than twenty years been continually receiving some proof of your affection for her. Accept our best thanks for so many favours I hope you had the letters safe we forwarded by Mr. Nicholas. The hearer of this is a young friend of ours who is going home with the intention of entering College. During his stay in London how much shall we feel obliged by your sometimes allowing him to visit you. I believe he is a truly pious young man, & the hopes of his being useful to this Colony some years hence (should his life be spared) induces him to leave his friends. He is the son of Mr. Hassall, who came out in the Duff, as a Missionary to Otaheite, you have heard of him no doubt. I think you will be pleased to hear that a Bible Society was formed at Sydney a few weeks since - the Governor was president, and upon the whole it was very well attended; my Father gave a short address which was so well received that the Lieut Governor expressed a wish that it might be published. I think I mentioned in my last that a school was established at Parramatta for the native children. There are now 17 children so that in the end I hope it will have the desired effect - Mr. & Mrs. Ellis & Mr. & Mrs. Orsmond have left us for Otaheite & I hope are now near the place of their destination. Mr. & Mrs. Barif remain a short time longer at Parramatta, on account. of Mrs. B, was confined at the time the ship sailed. The Missionaries at New Zealand were all well when the Active left them. I need say nothing of them, as it will be only to repeat what is written in the "Missionary Register," extracted from my Father's letters - That you may have some idea of Parramatta I send you a view of it, which is, I believe, very much like it, tho wretchedly painted our house is not in it -but when I have another favourable opportunity I will send you that and the Church.
My Mother requests me to say how much she should he grateful if you would favour her with a few lines; that tho' you write to my Father, which is nearly the same thing, yet still she wishes to hear from you herself; she regrets extremely that she is deprived of the pleasure of writing to you, but both her & us, ought to be very thankful that she enjoys her health so well, & that her memory is not in the least impaired - My Father is also very well, still as busy as ever. Should you see Mr. Thos Hassall, he will be much better able to give you every information both respecting us and the Country than I can write. Elizabeth, Charles, Mary, Jane & Martha are all well; My Mother says I must tell you all their names as she finds you did not know them till you saw them in my Father's letter to Duaterra, Mary will not be satisfied till she writes to Miss Hughes; she says she knows it was Mr. Stokes that sent out the dolls, ribbands, etc but she thinks that Miss H must have sent some of the pincushions, & therefore she will write to thank her for them. My Father & Mother beg their kindest regards to Mr. & Mrs. Hughes, & yourself, and believe me to be  
My dear Madam,
Yours very affectionately,
A. MARSDEN
