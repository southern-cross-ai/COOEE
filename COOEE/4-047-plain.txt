Surely they need missionaries and ministers there as much as in the heathen lands  Now darling I want you to give me a good scolding for something I wrote to you in my last letter about total abstinence. On reading over your diary I can see my darling is as strict as ever, and I am very sorry I ever wrote about it to you, for I am afraid you will think I have not sufficient trust in you. I am very sorry if I have pained you and I am afraid I have. Tell me I am a very naughty girl for writing such a thing and try and forgive your penitent little girl.
