Levi, M.L.C., of 'Liverpool', Princes-street, St. Kilda, was celebrated at the bride's residence, on Wednesday afternoon, November 2, at 2 o'clock. The Rev. Dr Joseph officiated, and Mr Sanders gave his daughter away. The Hon. N. Levi and Mrs Joseph Levi supported the bridegroom. After the ceremony, a reception was held in the drawing-room, round which garlands and festoons of greenery were arranged. The guests then adjourned to the handsomely decorated marquee where breakfast was served to a large number of guests. The bride's gown was composed of white ivory duchesse satin. The bodice was cut low, but the neck was covered in by a fichu of richly embroidered chiffon, edged with a fringe of orange blossom, which fell to the waist in front, and was finished off at the back under the large silk bow of the Watteau train. The skirt was bordered by a double box-pleat of silk. The veil worn with this gown was an embroidered Brussel's lace which had been worn by the bride's grandmother and mother in turn, and was fastened with a diamond star, the gift of the bridegroom. A chatelaine posy completed a most becoming toilet. There were five bridesmaids - the Misses Minnie, Carrie, Estelle and Zara Sanders (sisters of the bride), and Miss Florrie Davis. The Misses Minnie and Estelle Sanders were attired in eau de nil silk gowns made with the bell skirt, edged with a kilting of silk, and short bodices bordered with a fold of silk and having vests over which were drawn graceful fichus of chiffon. In a similar way the shell pink silk gowns of Miss Carrie and Miss Zara Sanders were made, and the daffodil dress of Miss Florrie Davis. Each maid wore a hat to correspond with her gown, the hats being black crinoline straws, trimmed with knots of ribbon grass, roses, and velvet to match the gowns. They carried pink posies with streamers, and wore crook brooches, at the back of which was the name of the bridegroom (who presented them). Mrs Sanders wore navy blue silk, with black lace; black bonnet with yellow roses; and posy of yellow roses. During the afternoon, Mr and Mrs Levi left on their honeymoon. The bride's travelling dress was grey tweed (tailor made) grey tweed cape with pink ribbon, and black hat with grass and velvet.
