My advice to such people would be to stay at home and content themselves and not be running of to Australia away from their relations and society. Yet he says he is content. If money is to be made at home how many men can get 7s. a day for harvesting and £1 a week and board as a ploughman. I know a young fellow named Brown who has £1 and board for attending to horses and doing a little farm work and another named McBride who is employed with a Mr Henry over beside James Reid's here who has 15s. per week and board. His work is not hard and he eat at the table with his master and mistress of everything of the best. I know for I have been often over there and has stopped nearly two days with them. 
Hugh Sheils is working to Alexander Perry at ringing trees. I suppose you would not know what ringing trees is if I did not tell you. It is to take about 6 broad of bark and the last spring's growth off right round its circumference. Young Jelly is going to Albury about a situation next week.
