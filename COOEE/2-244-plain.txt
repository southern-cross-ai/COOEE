My dear Papa
it is a very great pleasure to me to be able to give you the satisfactory intelligence of our safe arrival at Swan River. The Sterling came to anchor in Gages Roads off Fremantle on Sunday last. Mr. Brown landed in company with Mr. Lewis in the first boat that came along-side of the ship and proceeded on horseback to Perth, the seat of government. Every circumstance connected with landing me and the children with our servants and the freight has been concluded with great promptness. We are most hospitably entertained at Mr. Tanner's, his residence is sixteen miles further up the Swan than Perth which latter place is ten miles from Fremantle. Mr. Brown came here before returning to the ship and upon finding it was convenient to Mr. Tanner to receive us, made his way back again to the Vessel without delay to bring us all to Caversham. There was the ceremony to be gone through of having our people inspected by the Officer of health before they were permitted to go up the country and Dr. Criton whose duty it was to see them was obliging enough to come from Perth to Fremantle on purpose, at which latter place he was necessarily obliged to stop the night for our accommodation. I left the ship Wednesday morning with little Kenneth, Vernon, Sarah and two of the men servants and all our personal luggage. Ann was left behind to attend on Mrs. Forster the Chaplain's Wife who, is in a very sad state of health, she will remain to nurse her in her approaching confinement and join us when the ship has discharged cargo which will take three or four weeks yet to accomplish.
Leave has been given by the Governor for our goods to be placed in the government store free of expense for ware-house room until Mr. Brown has time and sees a fitting opportunity to dispose of them. A flock of sheep has already been purchased to begin stocking our Farm with even before a location has been fixed upon where to pursue our pastoral and agricultural occupations, a ship having arrived from Van Diemens Land with a cargo of sheep about the same time that we came into Port, it was too good a chance to be thrown away for procuring some. They were sold at a very reasonable rate, one pound ten each, Mr. Brown bought the whole of them 400 in number. Fruin who is a skilful shepherd wholly approves of them and they are under his care to bring by gentle stages to Caversham Rise. The cow shipped at Plymouth supplied abundance of milk the whole voyage, it was particularly of advantage to the children that we had a good supply, the expense of its keep on board was defrayed by the Passengers, we contributed four shares most willingly, the only expense the cow has been to us independent of this was the cost of the animal.  We have not been charged anything for freight, she is in very good condition and likely soon to have a calf. The Berkshire sow which Mr. Shrubb presented to us is come safely. I shall write again by the first ship that leaves direct for England, this will come by Van Diemens Land for which place I have but just heard there is a vessel on the point of sailing from hence. I have Emma, dear Matilda, and two or three friends to whom I wish to write.
Mr. Viveash arrived today from the York District, we are much pleased to see him and he appeared much so that we are come to the Colony. Land has much risen in value and is likely to be much dearer than at present. We have heard of several Farms for sale, Mr. Brown will immediately set about looking where to fix, he would write you but the time will not permit, he is making out a list of things necessary to be forwarded to us with despatch from London.
Of course I am all anxiety to hear tidings of William and all of you, pray write often. With kindest love to all my dear relatives
Believe me
Dearest Papa
Your Affectionate Daughter
E. Brown
