My Dear Friend 
You will excuse us for not writing to you before now. We would have done so only awaiting to See your uncle John who came down to See us both Himself and aunt Mary. Uncle Mike was out to see us also. They are all well so are all your Cousins in Heathcote. 
You my Friend seem to have a desire to Come out to this land of Health as you Consider it. I am giving you my oppinion of you you leaving Home. It may not be agreeable to your taste but I cannot help that. My advice to you would be and this is supported by all of your Friends to remain Contented at home & put the thoughts of a foreign land out of your head. You or nobody else ever experienced the dearly earned Crust got here. You I hope will remember its not all gold that glitters no not out here or no where else. 
You unfortunatly have a Stepmother who may not be the Kindest to you but you have a good Father who has well provided for you and who would not see you wronged.  You have also approached the age when you Can defy her to interfere much with you. Taking these things into account, we could not upon any Consideration advise you to Come out. We are surprised at your G Mother & uncle Lar & aunt Bridget for not throwing a little oil on the troubled waters and to endevour to check that wandering nature So Characteristic to our race. Uncle Lar appears to be youth all over, when He thinks of leaving his home. Well when I do read His letter I cannot help laughing at manner in which He worked his landlord. 
But I must not wander from the main point. There is nobody that I Know of more Suitable for this Country than Servants at home. There are of Course many Farmers Sons & Daughters to out here, but how are they situated. They are working hard from the rising of the Sun to the going down of the Same for a living in a burning hot Climate far different to Home & after all we find we are the poorest of the different nationalities in Australia. You may think I am oversteping the Mark but I am not. If I said otherwise I would tell an untruth & I do not mean to do that, & as for Storeeping all that buisness is done by men in this Country. I firmily believe there are not one hundred young women in the whole of Melbourne Storekeeping. We would all be very anxious to see you but to advise you to leave our Home its a thing we cannot do. Be advised by your Father & your fond friends in Lurrig & Some day we hope to hear from over the water that Kate Shanahan is now living happy & Contented in the old sod free from the dictates of a Step-mother & perfectly satisfied with the advise given Her by Philip Mahony. 
Dear Kate its the first time we heard that poor Norry Quirk was dead. We were very sorry to hear it & your uncle Lar never mentioned how her Father & Mother was in Cloyne. Tell your uncle Lar we were all glad of his letter. Ask him for me to request of my friends to write to me. I will soon write him a long letter hoping he is getting on well at farming also your Father. 
Tell G Mother Aunt Mary Came down to see us and remained for a week and John Came down after her unexpected with a little boy that went away from the Goverment Schools. Uncle Mike & Mrs was to see us also so we had one good meeting & the only time I felt myself at Home while in the Country. Uncle Pat is thinking of going Home soon. He says He will Take Johney with. 
I must also return our Sincere thanks for your Kindness in Sending the newspapers so regular to us. I have no more to Say only that you will remember us all fondly to G Mother uncle Lar Father & aunt Bridget & believe us to be all interested in your welfare your glory here & hope here after. These are the wishes of your fond Friends whose advice I hope you will accept. From Yours ever truly & affectionatly 
Phil. Mahony.
