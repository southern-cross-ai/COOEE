 the usual dull times are felt in Echuca as well as other parts of the colony. There has been changes at our place lately. Mr. Scott a man who has been in the establishment for over 12 years; the millinery saleswoman who has also been there about 12 years and the milliner about a year have all got the swap owing of course to dullness of trade. Mr. Scott will not be replaced and a milliner and saleswoman combined will take the place of the two ladies. The rest of us that were getting anything of a screw have been reduced 5s. a week. However it won't be much loss to me as I will have a greater run of sales owing to getting first sale in the department Mr. Scott left besides my own department as usual. We get premiums of many things we sell so you see I will have more work and possibly more premiums.
