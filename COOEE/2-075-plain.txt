I should rather impute your silence to the non receipt of said letter rather than to any other cause. I have now the pleasure of writing again and inform you that God has prospered my industry and exertions and that I have now the means with a continuation of industry to obtain a comfortable living much more so than I could in Ireland - however as you let that favourable opportunity pass, I as I am now a Free Subject can not obtain such another, but if you wish to come you can procure a cheap passage with Female Emigrants whose passage is defrayed by Government
