"May 25th, 1856. 
"MY DEAR MISS IRONSIDE,
These lines in themselves will furnish evidence that I have not forgotten you - amid all the anxieties and the multitude of petty business details connected with commencing business as a legal practitioner in a country town, you will perceive that my friends though 'out of sight' are by no means 'out of mind.' I had, you will recollect, promised myself the gratification, before leaving town, of showing your excellent mother and yourself Mr. Claxton's pictures. Circumstances, which to make use of the common phrase, I had 'no control over,' and which necessitated my departure for Goulburn at an earlier period than I had calculated upon, prevented this. A day or two prior to my quitting town, however, I called on Mr. Claxton and mentioned your name to him, as also my hope that I should have the pleasure of introducing your mother and yourself to him. As my leaving Sydney was at a notice so short as not only to prevent this, but not even to permit my bidding you farewell, I do my best under the circumstances, and rather than you should, my dear Miss Ironside, lose such an advantage as seeing a collection of really fine pictures, and in the presence of the Artist himself, I forward you herewith a note of introduction to Mr. Claxton. Very, very deeply interested do I feel in the development of the finer faculties of your mind - those which are fed and nerved and strengthened by acquaintance with and loving study of the beautiful. May I therefore, my dear Miss Ironside, beg that you will make use of this note of introduction? 
"I have quitted Sydney somewhat reluctantly, for a double purpose-the benefiting my health and the improvement of my worldly affairs. The former is, I fear, seriously shaken, and the latter are, from more causes than one, by no means what they ought to be in this Age of Gold, not however the 'bell eta dell oro' that Tasso so sweetly sung. I am anxious to live for my poor country's sake, for God knows she cannot afford the loss of one true son, fallen so low as she has these many dreary seasons. Make money I fain would, too, because I am conscious, and I have learned the bitter lore at the best of schools, that without a certain amount of worldly wealth a man can do nothing for his country or his fellows. And rather than live without the hope of doing somewhat of the sort, I would gladly welcome the coffin and the roses that are to wither and crumble about my shroud before the midnight coming. In Goulburn there is a very good prospect of succeeding as a legal practitioner, and I have every hope that I shall ere long return to Sydney with my finances in a more satisfactory condition, on the van of an opposition that will, I trust, scatter to the winds the present corrupt and imbecile Administration - an Administration that has apparently done its level best since its accession to power to degrade and drag into contempt the great institution of popular government. 
"This is a queer letter for a lady; but my affection for you, my dear Miss Ironside, is so mingled with respect for the soundness and strength of your feelings and your intellect as to justify it. I trust your amiable, excellent mother will enjoy Mr. Claxton's pictures - you yourself, being introduced by the enclosed note, can in turn introduce your mother. I think a capital task for you would be writing out descriptions and records of what you felt on the pictures and thought about them. I should like to see such a paper from your pen. How do you like Schlegel ? Trusting you will often let me hear of your studies and yourself, and with the kindest remembrances to your mother, 
"Believe me, 
"Yours faithfully, 
"D. H. DENIEHY." 
"Miss A. E. IRONSIDE."
