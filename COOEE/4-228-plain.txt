John has reserved the right to run 2 cows the mare and foal on the grass. He is busy now getting his garden ready for crop vegetables etc which he gets ready sale for at the Crossing hotel. 
I don't think there would be much good in David going up to John unless John got a contract for fencing some of his neighbour's land. In that case there would be work for them both but not otherwise. Besides the accommodations are not very great for John's is only a one roomed logged hut about 20 feet by 12 feet.
