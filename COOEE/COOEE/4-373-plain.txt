CHAPTER I. "LIFE IS SO DULL" 
"It is not for man to rest in absolute contentment. He is born to hopes and aspirations, as the sparks fly upwards, unless he has brutified his nature, and quenched the spirit of immortality, which is his portion." SOUTHEY. 
"Nancy!" 
"Well!" 
"What's the good of sitting there saying 'well' when you know I want you?" 
A pretty girl with golden brown hair and laughing blue eyes closed her book and, rising leisurely from the log on which she had been seated, crossed the orchard and joined her sister under the apple tree. 
"What do you want?" 
"Those hives are just full of honey, don't you think I might take some?" 
"I'm sure I don't know. I thought the book said bees ought to have enough left to feed them through the winter." 
"But it's only November. There are six months till the winter." 
"And how are you going to take the honey?" 
"Smoke the bees or something. That wretched book only tells about frame hives. Where am I go to get money for frame hives?" 
"Oh! gin cases do well enough, I think," said Nancy, cheerfully. "If you don't like them you can sell honey and buy others." 
"That's just it, I want to know how I'm to get the honey, and then, when I've got it, I want to know how I'm to sell it." 
 Phoebe Marsden was taller than her sister, and, so said the little world of brothers and sisters, not nearly so pretty, in fact not pretty at all. She was older too, more than two years older, almost twenty-four, and the eldest of the family. The younger ones looked on her as quite an old maid, and she herself felt her life, as far as any happiness or pleasure to herself went, was nearly over. She was nearly a quarter of a century old, a great age, so said her world, for a single woman, and she was inclined to think the world had no use for her. 
"Mother will buy it from you. You know she said she would." 
"Yes, I know. Poor mother," and Phoebe laughed scornfully. "She'll give me about a penny a pound, and pay me when she has the money. It'll come dribbling in, and I'll feel myself a brute for taking it, especially after the boys have eaten all the honey." 
Nancy was a little afraid of the bees, but she saw Phoebe had a discontented fit on, and settling herself down on the grass at full length, prepared to listen, and if possible console. 
"It's about that I'm afraid. I told you before, Phoebe, it isn't the least good in the world trying to do anything for yourself. Why can't you let things alone, like me?" 
"Because - because," there was almost a sob in the elder girl's voice, "what on earth is to become of us? It seems to me we get poorer and poorer, father gets less and less to do, and the family expenses get heavier and heavier. Just look at those boys growing up." 
"I do look," said Nancy, "with sorrow." 
"Not a penny have I had this month." 
"Nor me. Look at those becoming shoes. Don't they look sweet," and she drew her petticoats up and looked down at her feet. Whether they were pretty feet or not and matched the rest of their dainty owner it was impossible to say, for those shoes were in the last stage of decrepitude, the leather showed wrinkled and cracked through the blacking, and there was a deplorable split close to the toe of the left foot. Nancy looked at them a little dolefully. 
"Somebody will have to buy me a pair of new ones. Talk about 'travelling on your uppers'! And mother will sigh and look as distressed as if the bottom had fallen out of the world, and as for father - well, it's no good; I'd rather go barefoot than face father. He makes me feel as if I hadn't a right to exist at all." 
 "I don't think we have," sighed the elder girl. "How can you take it so coolly, Nanny?" 
"What is the good of worry, worry, worry? Phoebe, you're just as bad as mother. It's the loveliest day - just look at the sunshine. I've actually hit on a book I haven't read more than once before. I don't think there's anything particular to do, or if there is, father isn't here to reprove me for idleness, so I'm just going to loaf and enjoy myself." 
"How can you? I wish I could. Do you really feel happy, Nancy?" and her elder sister looked down on her wistfully. 
"Happy?" Nancy lay back on the grass, and pillowing her head on her arms looked up at the patches of bright blue sky which peeped through the branches of the apple tree - "happy? Why, of course I do. Don't you?" 
"No," sighed the elder, "no, never." 
"You're older than me, I suppose," said Nancy, vainly trying to find some reason for this uncomfortable state of affairs. 
"I've always been old, I think," said her sister. "When I was quite a little girl I was always too old to do the nice things the rest of you did, and if you did anything wrong I got scolded because I was the eldest and ought to have looked after you better, or exerted a better influence, or something of that sort. Oh dear! it's a mistake to be the eldest." 
"I don't know, I believe I'd have been contented enough even if I had been in that unhappy position." 
"I believe you would. How is it, Nancy, you always manage to be cheerful, while I - well I - " 
"You are not - no, indeed you're not. You're very much the other way just now." 
Phoebe cast another mournful glance at the gin cases that did duty as hives, then slipped down on to the grass beside her sister. She did not lie down though - there was nothing indolent about Phoebe. 
"There seems nothing in the world to look forward to." 
"Don't look forward, then. I'm sure it's very nice here." 
"When father comes home tonight he's sure to be depressed; we shall be told that he hasn't earned five pounds this week, and if this goes on - " 
"Oh, Phoebe, don't bother! What do you listen for if it makes you feel bad?" 
"I listen of course - I must. I know there's a certain amount of truth in it. So do you. His business is falling off;  there are so many younger men coming on, and really I don't know that there is room in Ballarat for so many stock and station agents." 
"Oh, it will all come right in the end. Things always do." 
"You always say that, Nancy, but what will we do if they don't? / Nancy laughed. 
"Oh! all men rub along somehow. Where's the good of worrying? You'll spoil your beauty." 
"I haven't got any." 
Candidly speaking Nancy did not think her sister had. She did not admire her face herself, but she did not want to hurt her feelings, so she laughed gently and said - 
"What a goose you are to believe all the boys say! I believe you think yourself quite hideous." 
Phoebe nodded her head and blinked her eyes in a vain attempt to keep the tears back. It is cruelly hard on a young woman to have to acknowledge to herself that she is ugly. 
Beside Nancy's sparkling eyes and fresh complexion her sister's pale face looked sallow; her dark hair, though abundant, was dull in hue; her heavy brown eyes were too deep-set, and her whole face wore a sad and discontented air which alone would have spoiled far greater beauty than she possessed. Her figure was good and she was tall, and had she had but that place in the world which she was always longing for, there would have been many to call the eldest Miss Marsden a handsome woman. But at home, father, mother, sisters, brothers, all considered and frankly said she was plain - hopelessly plain, said her mother, who could not conceive of a good-looking woman over five feet five, which necessarily meant large hands and feet. 
When Phoebe was eighteen she had already fixed her fate in her mind. 
"She will be an old maid," she told her only sister, plaintively. Mrs Marsden was a woman who must confide in somebody, her husband for choice; but, as she said, there were some things one could not tell a man, he would not understand, and so she overflowed to her sister on the rare occasions on which they met. "She'll never marry. I don't see that I can do anything with Phoebe." 
"I believe some men might call her handsome," said Mrs Carrington, thoughtfully, "if she were well dressed." 
And that was the only commendation poor Phoebe had ever received, and even that she had never heard, and Mrs Carrington was away in England now, and had forgotten all about her. 
The family thought Phoebe plain, and she was plain; it was almost cause and effect. How could she be good-looking in the face of such adverse opinions? Besides, even her aunt had said, "if she were well dressed," and she was never well dressed and never likely to be. 
Nancy had more than a suspicion of Phoebe's struggle with her tears, and suddenly lifting up her head rolled herself into her sister's lap and put a caressing arm round her waist. 
"Phoebe, you old silly, I don't think you are ugly." 
"I - I - Nancy, it isn't that. I know I'm ugly, but I don't believe I'd mind so much if I was a man." 
"A man! Phoebe!" 
"Or could earn a decent living for myself. It's the same thing, isn't it?" 
"But how could you earn your own living? It's silly to talk like that." 
Phoebe looked down at the pretty face on her knee, and wound her fingers through the sunny curls with a sigh. 
"We can't live on for ever like this, you know. Father and mother will die some day." 
"Phoebe!" 
"Well, they will. Mother is forty-six and father is over fifty." 
"Oh, Phoebe!" 
Nancy was shocked. Such conversation seemed to her brutal. The two girls somehow, though they had had the same training, could not help looking at life from diametrically opposite points of view. 
"Yes, I know you are shocked," went on the elder, now thoroughly worked up, and bent on expounding her ideas, even though it was to no purpose, "but suppose father did die, what would become of us all?" 
"It is cruel to talk about such things!" 
"It would be still more cruel if they happened, which I hope they won't; but still, suppose they do? Stanley couldn't keep us and won't be able to keep himself for a good many years to come." 
"Oh, Stanley will get married as soon as ever he can afford to," said Nancy. Stanley came between the two girls, and was, in his second-year laws, an authority to all the household on the ways of the world, for did he not live in Melbourne, and had he not for his allowance more money in one year than the girls had in four? Phoebe felt a little bitter towards her eldest brother. If he from his position outside the home circle, with his supposed knowledge of the world, had had a good word to say for her, had given her one word of praise, her position among her younger brothers and sisters would have been materially improved; but he did no such thing. She did not happen to come up to his ideal of physical beauty, so he uncompromisingly pronounced her ugly; she had views on various subjects, and had expressed her disapproval of his noble self very freely when he missed his second year - and he posed as one who should be admired - therefore he revenged himself as he had the power to do. 
He explained to his mother that his eldest sister was just the sort old maids are made of. Fancy a fellow marrying a girl like that, plain as a pikestaff, and gives herself airs - faugh! Nancy, in his opinion, was all right, some fellow was sure to come along and marry her, but Phoebe - 
All of which had filtered through not only to the girls themselves, but to the rest of the family, and Phoebe's happiness was not increased thereby; and even though she admitted the truth of the unkind speech, she did not love the brother who had made that speech the more for it. 
"Well, Stanley might manage to keep himself, but what would become of mother and the rest of us?" 
"What nonsense you do talk!" said Nancy, settling herself more comfortably on her sister's lap. "Father isn't going to die until he's quite old - when we are all grown up." 
"Even then - ," began Phoebe, but her sister cut her short. 
"Then the boys will all be earning their own livings, and we will be all married." 
"You may - I suppose you will - and so will Nellie; but what's to become of Lydia and me?" 
"You'll get married too." 
"The boys say I won't," said Phoebe gloomily, "and they say Lydia is just like me. Poor little Lyd!" 
"Oh! what is the good of minding what the boys say? Of course you will get married!" 
"Who can I marry?" asked the elder. "No one ever cared about me, no one ever does care for me. The few men we know all like talking to you and never take any notice of me." 
"We don't know any worth troubling our heads about." 
 "There, I told you so!" with gloomy triumph. "If we don't know any men how are we to marry them?" 
"Oh, I don't know. Husbands come down the chimney for good girls, you know." 
"It's not fair! it's not fair!" burst out Phoebe, passionately; and she pushed her sister aside, and rising to her feet began pacing up and down under the apple tree. "A woman's just a useless thing, to sit still and do nothing but look pretty until some man comes along and says, 'I think you're rather good-looking, it pleases my majesty to marry you.'" 
"Don't you be afraid," a mocking man's voice came from behind, "there's no fear of any one accusing you of looking pretty, and still less of any fellow asking you to marry him." 
"Stanley!" 
Phoebe turned quickly with flushed face and glowing dark eyes, and for just that moment her brother thought that that face gave the lie to his words, but he did not acknowledge it even to himself. 
"You needn't trouble your head, my dear," he said with brotherly candour, "no one's at all likely to marry you. You are just cut out for the old maid of the family." 
"That's just exactly what I've been saying." It wasn't, but under the circumstances strict accuracy could hardly be expected. "And as I'm to be an old maid, I don't want to live a life like this always. I might as well have a little money or something to do in the world." 
"Something to do in the world - bah! It's enough to make a fellow sick to hear a girl talk like that. You're as bad as the awful females at the shop." 
"Some of those awful females, as you call them," said Phoebe, mockingly, "have left you far and away behind. Look at Miss Wilson, a full-blown B.A., and you only in your second year!" 
"Miss Wilson be hanged! What does a girl have to do but grind?" 
"I wish - " 
"Oh yes, I know you. But let me tell you, all the decent fellows think like I do, and all the decent people too. Do you ever see a girl from good society up at the University? No, of course you don't. Decent girls have more sense. I know the sorts of girls I like, and there are lots and lots of chaps like me." 
"Come, then," said Nancy from her lowly position on the grass, "tell us what she is like." For Phoebe, as usual in an encounter with her brother, was silenced by his scornful insinuations - insinuations which at the bottom of her heart she believed to be true: that she, being so much less attractive than the majority of girls, had no right to judge the world of women from her point of view. 
"Well, a girl ought to stick at home. She oughtn't to bother her head about Latin and Greek. Who wants his wife to know anything about mathematics? My wife's going to dance beautifully, and she must play and sing, and she might paint a bit - just enough to decorate the drawing-room. And then if she can cook a bit and sew a little, that's all I want." 
"Moderate, certainly." 
"She'll have to be pretty, of course. Ugly women ought to be shut up or smothered or something. Blest if I see what use they are." 
"What about ugly men?" 
"Oh, a man don't matter; but I say, you girls, are you aware that I've come all the way from Melbourne, driven out the seven miles from Ballarat, and I'm as hungry as a hunter." 
"Are you, really?" asked Nancy, laughing. "I suppose you didn't bring that perfect girl along with you to wait on you?" 
"Don't be a fool, Nancy! I never said you were ugly" - and the slight emphasis on the "you" did not escape the elder girl's notice - "I only said - and all fellows, decent fellows with any sense, think like me - that all this talk about higher education for women is all bunkum. No fellow likes a learned wife. Let the women stick at home and mind their houses. A nice girl's pretty sure to get married in the end; what does she want spoiling herself earning her own living?" 
"I was thinking about the girls who aren't nice," began Phoebe. 
"Hang the girls who aren't nice!" 
"By all means, if you can do it," said Phoebe, politely sarcastic. "But I do believe there are some girls in the world who don't want to be only a reflection of a man. Wasn't the world made for women as well as men?" 
But he could not understand her. He was not a bad fellow at bottom, he meant kindly enough, but he was young and egotistical, and he was most firmly imbued with the idea that the world was most certainly made for men, and women should only look on it through men's eyes. Besides, his eldest sister irritated him. She was hopelessly plain, in his opinion she ought to accept that fact and sink quietly into the background. It was hard enough on him, he thought, to have a plain old maiden sister, without her asserting herself and even by inference lecturing him, who, if he was not good in the schools, was certainly one of the best athletes at the Melbourne University. 
"I wish you wouldn't talk such infernal rot," he said, "I'm sick of it! You are only talking about things you don't understand in the least." 
"It is my life," thought Phoebe, but she did not put her thoughts into words. He would not have understood. It was a woman's business to sit still and look pretty, and wait what Fate would bring her. If the future were good to her, then she should have praise and petting in plenty; but if it were not, then she should be treated as if it were her own fault. But practically she could do nothing to alter her life. The thought weighed heavily on her this bright summer afternoon, and took the sunshine out of the day for her. 
"Well" - Stanley felt he had wasted quite enough time over a sister, even if she were a pretty one - "well, isn't one of you girls going to get a fellow something to eat?" 
"Phoebe will, I daresay," said Nancy, lazily; "she's just burning to show her usefulness in the world." 
"Well, here's a chance for her," said her brother, and Phoebe flashed round angrily. He thought her ugly, he thought ugly girls ought to be put out of the way, he wounded her without the slightest thought - why, then, should she wait on him? Angry words rose to her lips and died away there. What was the good of quarrelling? He didn't understand, not one of her little world understood her. She supposed there must be something radically wrong in her composition, evidently she was not like other girls. If Nancy would not get Stanley something to eat she must, and she went into the house with as good a grace as possible, which after all was not very good, and made him tell his mother that evening that Phoebe was more unbearably old-maidish than ever - a remark which in time reached the culprit's ears, and did not materially add to her peace of mind. 
Nancy did not stir. She understood her brother in one way far better than her sister did. He would not like her any the less because she gave herself little airs and did not wait on him hand and foot, and she had none of Phoebe's earnest desire to do the right thing. As she had explained to her sister, she had no object in life save to get through it pleasantly, and this was just the right sort of afternoon for a loaf in the garden. Soon it would be too hot to be out of doors, but today, lying here on the grass under the apple tree, it was perfect. 
A high hedge hid the house from sight, and no one was likely to disturb her, therefore she closed her eyes and prepared to make the most of it. She couldn't read. The soft wind blew the leaves over and lost her place, it made her arm ache to hold up the book, the drowsy hum of the bees - poor Phoebe's bees - was in her ears, and from the paddock behind came the sound of children's voices, softened by the distance. It made her feel sleepy. Those children were chasing the ducks again, she reflected, and wondered lazily if Phoebe would hear them and put a stop to it. Then her eyes closed, it was so pleasant here under the tree, and when Phoebe came back, after providing her brother with afternoon tea, she was fast asleep. 
Phoebe sighed discontentedly. She had had no tea herself, not that she did not like it, but because, except on rare occasions, the family finances did not run to it, and now it was an added grievance that her confidante should be in the land of dreams. Then the children's voices caught her ear, the unlawful nature of the occupation struck her, and she went across the orchard to investigate. It was not in Phoebe to shirk any duty, however unpleasant, and Nancy was left alone to sleep her sleep out. 
The shadows grew longer and longer. Mr Marsden's buggy came home, and was received with much yelling and shouting by the children; she was dimly conscious that the nursery tea-bell ran furiously, and also conscious that it was her turn to look after that meal, but still she did not rouse herself. She was not called, it was all right. Phoebe, in her own ungracious fashion, had probably taken her place, and Nancy settled herself comfortably to sleep again. Then a leaf or two dropped softly on to her face and on her ungloved hand, and she started up wide awake in a moment. 
"Good gracious! What - " 
"Fairly won, by Jove! Miss Nancy - fairly won! That's a pair of gloves to Ned." 
"It isn't! I - . How dare you!" 
Nancy sat up rubbing her eyes, angry and startled, but not so angry but that she remembered to pull down her skirts over her feet to hide those worn-out shoes from the eyes of the two young men who were standing over her. 
"Don't be cross, Miss Nancy," said the taller of the two; "we've been waiting so long for you to wake, Ned here felt he had to try other means." 
"Then he - he - " 
But Ned Kirkham looked down on her with grave, dark eyes, and she forgave him on the spot, or rather she expressed her belief there was nothing to forgive. 
"I know you wouldn't; would you, now?" 
"Of course not. Allan here dropped some leaves on your face. I wouldn't be so impertinent." 
"I knew it," said Nancy, in gleeful triumph. "There now, Mr Morrison!" 
"It's all very well to say, 'there now,' Miss Nancy, but you don't know what catastrophe might have happened if I hadn't been here to look after this young cousin of mine. You - " 
"I've been asleep all the afternoon. One might as well do that as anything else, I think. You never told me you were coming, else - " 
"Else you would have stayed awake?" 
"Oh, I didn't say that," said Nancy, who was wishing she had on her evening shoes, the only decent pair she had left, and felt it to be a real grievance that she had been caught in such shabby ones. "But how did you come? Over the fence?" 
Ned Kirkham nodded, and Allan Morrison asked - 
"Do you think the governor'll object?" 
"He won't know," said Nancy, philosophically. "Now you are here, won't you sit down?" 
Morrison, who was an older man than his cousin, Ned Kirkham, by seven or eight years, accepted the invitation and took a seat close beside her, while the other man, folding his arms, leaned up against the apple tree in such a position that he could carefully scan the fair face beneath him. She blushed a little under his steadfast gaze, but it did not discommode her much. 
"I am sorry to say," began Morrison, gravely, "there's been a sad catastrophe." 
"I thought your presence averted that," said Nancy, mischievously. 
"I? I wasn't there," said Morrison, who had completely forgotten the chaff of a few minutes ago, "I wish to the Lord I had been. Ned and I were burning off at the other end of our place, and the confounded jumbucks got into your wheat." 
"Your sheep in our wheat! Oh, goodness, gracious me!" 
"It is 'oh, goodness gracious me!' with a vengeance. Looks as if about forty thousand of them had been revelling in it. There were only fifty really, but - but - " 
"They had a real good time," said Nancy, smiling. 
"They did indeed. And your kids, when they drove them out - " 
"Had a real good time too. Yes, I know what our children are when they get the chance of being useful." 
"Well, they did trample the crop a good deal," said Morrison; "but the question is, what is to be done? Ned and I thought we'd better come and see when your father will be at home. We must offer him compensation, you know." 
"For the boys trampling the wheat?" 
"If the sheep hadn't been there the boys wouldn't have gone after them." 
"And if the fence had been properly mended, as it should have been, the sheep wouldn't have trespassed at all. What are you going to do? See my respected parent, and abuse him for not having his fence in proper repair?" 
"Well, you know," said Morrison, who was a Scotchman, and believed in his own rights, "that fence is just rotten." 
"I know, I know. It's tumbling to pieces and we ought to have a new one, and we have not a penny piece to do it with. Oh, I've heard the story over and over again, and I'll hear it again tonight." 
"Will your father be very wrath, Miss Nancy?" asked Kirkham. 
"I don't know that it will make much difference," said Nancy, with a little grimace, "he's always cross. I don't know why we mind telling him about any fresh disaster. We ought not to really, because if the bottom had fallen out of the world bodily he couldn't be worse than he was this morning." 
"And you suffer. Poor little girl!" said Morrison, sympathetically, but the tender look that came from Kirkham's brown eyes went straight to her heart. 
"After all, I'm not the one to be pitied," she said. "I retire and leave mother or Phoebe to bear the brunt. Phoebe is the one who takes things to heart." 
"Don't you?" 
"No, of course not. Where is the good of worrying?  Phoebe has views, and is always wanting to do something for herself." 
"Lord! She don't know what she's asking," said Morrison. "Ned and I could give her a wrinkle or two." 
Nancy glanced up at Kirkham's gloomy face. 
"Why? Aren't things going well with you?" she asked, sympathetically. 
"Well? Good Lord, no! We've about bottomed, I think. The wood is the only thing that pays on the wretched place. We always buy our sheep dear and sell cheap, the cows ain't no good, the horses die, the pigs - " He paused in the catalogue of woes and threw up his head despairingly. 
"Well," said Nancy smiling. "I'm glad the wood pays." 
"Yes, but my dear child," - Morrison was very much in earnest - "We don't want to live out the rest of our lives as splitters." 
"Oh, but times will mend." 
"Mend!" Kirkham's face was gloomily hopeless. "There's not much chance of mending, I'm afraid." 
"Then what will you do?" Nancy's voice caught a touch of the prevailing gloom. 
"Do? We'll - Ah, how do you do, Miss Marsden?" 
Phoebe, coming silently across the grass, shook hands with both men and looked reproachfully at her sister. 
"It's all right, Phoebe," said that young lady cheerfully. "I haven't been arranging a clandestine meeting with two young men, if that is what you are thinking. They have come over with sorrow to announce a fresh disaster to the family. Their sheep have been in the twelve-acre again, and we're just consoling each other in our poverty-stricken condition." 
"Really, Miss Marsden," said Morrison, "I'm awfully sorry - " 
"Never mind," interrupted Phoebe, "I know all about it. The children have just been telling father." 
"And - Is he very vexed?" 
"Vexed? I don't know. Something went wrong in town, and - " 
"We're all on the doorstep of the Benevolent Asylum," interrupted Nancy, flippantly. "There now," turning to Kirkham, "you needn't worry about it any more. Our wheat never is any good somehow. If it manages to grow up all right, it gets spoiled when they reap it, or it gets left out in the rain, or something. It's lucky the bread supply does not depend on us." 
"We go the wrong way about it," sighed Phoebe. "I wish to goodness father would let me manage just for a year and ask no questions. I know I could make it pay." 
"Could you, Miss Marsden?" asked Morrison, sceptically. "It's more than Ned and I can, then. All those blessed sheep are down on their knees with foot-rot, and we are just thinking of chucking up the whole thing, bag and baggage." 
"Going away?" cried Nancy in dismay, while Phoebe merely shrugged her shoulders. 
"Of course," she said, "it was just madness to take Bandara, poor swamp land like that, what could you expect? If you must go in for cockatoo farming, you ought to have taken the Hill Farm up above there." 
"Listen to Phoebe," mocked Nancy - "talking as if she were a land agent at least." 
"Well, she talks common sense, anyhow," said Morrison, "as I know to my cost. But I'd been so long in the back blocks that the green grass looked awfully attractive. I never guessed what a glue-pot it would be in the winter." 
"Take the Hill Farm now," suggested Phoebe, pleased at the modicum of praise she received from her hero, and Nancy eagerly seconded her. 
"Oh, yes, do. It's to let cheap to good tenants." But Morrison shook his head. 
"It's no good," he said. "We don't want to be cockatoo farmers all our lives, and that's what it would mean. Ned could have done as well as this in England without leaving his own people." 
Nancy's eyes stole shyly to Kirkham's face, and much to her relief did not read there any signs of great regret at having left the old country. And Morrison went on - 
"We want to make our fortunes." 
"Lucky people," sighed Phoebe. "I only want to make my own living, but there doesn't seem to be the ghost of a chance." 
"Well, no, you are a woman, you see," said Morrison, watching with a pang the other two exchange glances, "some one else has got to do that for you." 
Phoebe sighed. No one understood her, not even the man to whom she gave the highest place in her small world. He talked to her, but he watched her sister's bright face the while.  Then he sighed at what he read there, and the elder girl echoed the sigh. There was evidently something wrong in the scheme of creation. 
"Well, what are you thinking of doing?" she asked, after a pause given up to bitter reflections. 
Morrison hesitated, and looked doubtfully at his cousin. 
"It's a wild scheme," he said at last. "There may be a mint of money in it, or it may all end in smoke, and the next time you see your friends they'll be tramping the country looking for work, with swags on their backs and quart pots in their hands." 
"All right," said Nancy, "come along this road, and we will give you tea and come and pour it out for you." 
"But you will succeed. I know you will succeed," said Phoebe. 
"Won't you tell us what it is? It seems to me almost anything would be better than stagnating here right out of the world." 
"It's a deal further out of the world where we propose to go," laughed Morrison. "Don't scoff, and I'll tell you." 
"Oh, we won't scoff," said Nancy, "but I can't see what you want going at all." 
"You read about the gold discoveries at Dowden's Creek, up in the north?" said Morrison, and Phoebe nodded her head - she always read the papers. "Well," he went on, "I know that country, and I know some like it just two hundred miles to the west. If there's gold at Dowden's Creek there's gold in the Boolcunda country, I'll take my colonial oath on that." 
"But," objected Phoebe, "there was very little gold at Dowden's Creek. It was soon worked out." 
"I know the man who discovered it," said Morrison, warming to his subject, "and he cleared twenty thousand pounds before ever the rush took place. Now twenty thousand would just suit Ned and me to a T. We ain't greedy. Five hundred a year certain would just give us something to go upon, and, of course, we'd make more than five hundred." 
Nancy opened her eyes. 
"Oh, yes; five hundred a year would be very nice, if you could get it; but it just seems to me a wild goose chase." 
"No, it isn't; indeed it is not. Is it, Miss Marsden?" cried Kirkham, appealing to Phoebe, in order to convince her sister. "That's generally the way gold has been found before, only you must keep the secret. We must be first in the field." 
 "Yes; mum's the word," said Morrison. "Just you wait, Miss Nancy, till you see the wealthy gold-diggers returning laden with the spoils. You ought to promise us a triumphal arch and a band, at the very least." 
"Oh, I'll promise you," said Nancy, laughing to try and hide the fact that the tears were very near the surface, "only I'm afraid you won't deserve it. You'll forget all about us, and never come back any more. Why don't you take the Hill Farm, and be content with enough to live on?" 
"Because we're sick to death of cockatoo farming, and we are going to make a bid for fortune. It's neck or nothing this time, I can tell you." 
Both men sighed, as if it were already decided it should be nothing, and the girls echoed that sigh. What would their life be like when these, their next-door neighbours, the only decent young men within reach, as Nancy openly said, were gone? 
But neither could put their thoughts into words. The shadows had grown longer and longer; it was manifestly near the hour when the elder members of the Marsden family had their evening meal; but even careful Phoebe forgot for once to notice the flight of time; all four stood silent for a moment, then the older girl said, gravely - 
"If there's any chance of succeeding, I really think you ought to go." 
"Yes, I - "began Morrison. Then, with a sudden change of tone, "Oh, I say, here's your father." 
Nancy scrambled to her feet, forgetful for once of the shabby shoes, and both girls looked round uneasily. They were doing nothing morally wrong, yet both started apart guiltily. In truth, Mr Marsden was not an easy man to deal with. He strode across the orchard with long, quick strides, his downbent head never raised, yet both girls were horribly conscious that those keen blue eyes of his had taken them and their companions in long before they had perceived his long, thin figure coming towards them. That would have been all right if only he would have come up and spoken, but both felt, too, that he would, if not stopped, pass on without taking any notice, and probably later on they would hear from their mother how much their father disapproved of their conduct in talking to young men in a clandestine manner in the orchard. Nancy wished helplessly the earth would open and swallow her up, and Phoebe stood still, with a sullenness that had something of despair in it. Morrison saw their difficulty and stepped across their father's path. 
"Good evening, sir," he said. "My cousin and I came over to see you." 
"Indeed," said Mr Marsden, coldly. "I don't usually see people in the orchard." 
Nancy raised her eyebrows for Kirkham's benefit, and Morrison went on, steadily and civilly. 
"It was about those blessed sheep, sir. I'm sorry." 
Mr Marsden never stopped in his walk for a moment, and a flush of shame mounted to Phoebe's cheek as she saw he had to follow after her father to make himself heard. Nancy gave a sigh of relief. 
"That's done," she said to Kirkham. "I do hope he won't be outrageously rude to poor Mr Morrison. I've long given over trying to tame the savage beast. When I find he's in one of these sweet tempers I just retire and leave the coast clear." 
"Nancy!" remonstrated her sister. 
"Oh, it's all very way to say 'Nancy,' in shocked tones, Phoebe, but it's no good pretending father is sweet or amiable, or even decently civil, is it? Mr Kirkham has eyes. You don't call that good old English manners, do you, Mr Kirkham?" 
Kirkham laughed. He himself was certainly glad to see his cousin beard the lion in his den. After next month the old gentleman's tantrums wouldn't affect him one way or the other. He was sorry for the girls though, and did his best to smooth matters over for them. 
"Old gentlemen, even in England, Miss Marsden," he said, with a smile, "sometimes get out of temper, and make things unpleasant for - for - " 
"Their daughters, and their daughters' friends," said Nancy. "There's one thing about father, he is abominably rude to you, but it must be constitutional; he can't help it, he'd be just the same to the Prince of Wales or - or St Michael and all the angels. I hope and pray it isn't hereditary. I've fancied of late I've seen signs of it in Stanley. I'm afraid I'll have to remonstrate with him on the subject." 
Kirkham looked over his shoulder. Through the fruit trees he could see the persistent Morrison had at last succeeded in cornering Mr Marsden in the extreme end of the orchard, where the only alternative was to stand and listen or to turn and hurriedly retrace his steps. 
 Phoebe watched them, too, uneasily. Then a bell up at the house rang out loudly, and Nancy turned to Kirkham. 
"That is our tea," she said. "We really must go for it at once. Father will be back in a minute, and I wouldn't walk up to the house with him for worlds. Oh, dear! it's going to be such a lovely moonlight night. I wish I could ask you in and we could sit on the verandah and talk, but - " 
"Thank you very much, Miss Nancy, for the kindly thought." Kirkham looked his pleasure. It was not very often his lady love was so gracious to him. "I suppose I may walk up to the house with you, mayn't I? I don't suppose your father would be best pleased if he saw me getting over the fence." 
At the house door Phoebe hurriedly bid him good-bye and entered. She was uncomfortably conscious that her sister wanted a word alone with him, and yet was fearful lest her father should come up and catch them before he was gone. Phoebe's name, as Nancy often said, should have been Martha, she was troubled by so many things. 
But for once in a way the same thought had occurred to Nancy, and she cut her adieux remarkably short. 
"When shall I see you again?" he asked, laying a detaining hand on her arm. 
"Goodness knows," said she, carelessly, though in reality she was as anxious as he. "Come over some day, in the evening. If it's fine, you are pretty sure to find Phoebe and me in the orchard. And - there, I really must go. Mind you come." And she vanished into the house, while the young man, not desirous of second interview with the house's master, hurriedly made his way along the drive to the front gate. 

CHAPTER II. THE UNATTRACTIVE MEMBER OF THE FAMILY 
"'I mean to be somebody, and to do something useful in the world,' said the eldest of five brothers. 'I don't care how humble my position is, so that I can only do some good, which will be something. I intend to be a brickmaker; bricks are always wanted, and I shall be really doing something.'" - HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN 
The schoolroom, or breakfast-room, as it was indifferently called at Weeroona, was a plainly furnished room, the floor covered with linoleum and the chairs of Austrian cane pattern, the couch was anything but a couch of ease, and the only other furniture in the room was a book-case, which Mr Marsden was wont to stigmatise as 'hideously' untidy. Phoebe sometimes made desperate efforts to reduce it to order, but her father on these occasions either took no notice of it at all or grumbled at the way in which she arranged the books, and then her struggles after law and order suffered a relapse, and she allowed the children to work their wicked will upon it. 
She was just at present in a state of relapse, and the room, bare as it was, certainly looked as if it wanted some kindly hand to reduce it to a state of comfort. The Marsden family lived there. They had both a dining-room and a drawing-room, well and comfortably furnished, but they very seldom sat in them, unless, in the winter-time, when occasional fires were lighted to keep the damp and mildew out. The breakfast-room was the living room, that was part of Mrs Marsden's economies. 
She was already seated at the head of the tea-table, surrounded by the teapot and half a dozen cups and saucers of the common white-and-gold pattern. Her best service only saw the light on rare occasions. She was a little woman, below the ordinary height, with a look of Nancy in her faded, fretful face, but her eyes were dark as Phoebe's own, and her hair, too, though plentifully streaked with grey, had once been black as the proverbial raven's wing. 
She looked up from her knitting as Phoebe entered. 
"Where's your father?" she asked. "Late, as usual. Cook's made some scones, and they'll all be quite cold if he doesn't come at once." 
"Never mind," said Phoebe, whose mind was relieved by hearing Nancy's footsteps following her down the passage. "I don't suppose he will eat the scones. He will say they are indigestible. He is in the orchard, and he must have heard the bell, because I was there, and I heard it quite plainly. But Stanley and Nellie aren't in yet." 
"Oh, they'll come. I don't mind about them, but I don't like your father to be late. I know you were in the orchard, because - well, your father is very vexed about it." 
"About what?" asked Nancy, appearing on the scene to defend herself. 
"About your being there talking to those young men. He saw you from the road as he was coming in." Nancy made a mental note of that for future use. "And he's very vexed. It is just like servant girls, he says." 
"What is?" asked Nancy. She was not in the least afraid of her mother. 
"Why, meeting young men like that. Leaning over a fence, and talking to them, instead of - " 
"Coming into the drawing-room, and sitting prop chitty on two chairs, I suppose. Well, if father sees any harm in what we did this evening he must be looking for it, that's all I can say. Besides we weren't there so very long. I was sound asleep on the grass by myself most of the time." 
"So bad for you," murmured Mrs Marsden, and Nancy went on unheeding - 
"Then Mr Kirkham and Mr Morrison came over - " 
"And your father doesn't like them getting over the fence," put in Mrs Marsden. 
"Just to tell us that their sheep had got into the twelve acre, and if you see anything wrong in that, why you had better make arrangements to keep us locked up in our rooms for the remainder of our lives," finished Nancy, bringing her defence to a triumphant conclusion. 
 "They should come up to the house and ask for me," commented the mother, feebly. "As your father says, it's not proper for young girls - " 
"You don't call Phoebe a young girl, surely," put in Stanley, entering and taking his seat at the table. "I thought everybody knew she was comfortably settled on the shelf. Anything decent to eat? Give us a chop, Phoebe." 
Phoebe took her seat at the bottom of the table and, raising the dish cover, began serving. 
"Very well, mother," she said, for once making capital out of her brother's rudeness; "if I'm on the shelf I should think I might do whatever I please without anybody making remarks. And there was no harm in our talking to those two men in the orchard." 
"The wonder is they cared to stop and talk to you," said her brother, who somehow could never resist teasing his sister. To do him justice, he hardly understood how cruel his remarks were. "But I suppose it was Nancy they came after, eh Nan? Jack says they're both awfully mashed on you." 
Nancy tossed her head and laughed a denial, which deceived nobody, least of all her sister. It was true, she knew, most true. Stanley knew it, at any rate thought it most probable, she herself saw it, even young Jack saw it, and she sighed to herself as her father entered the room and took his seat in dead silence.
