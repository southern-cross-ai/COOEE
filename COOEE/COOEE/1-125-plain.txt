By virtue of the powers vested in me, I have assigned you, William Henry now of Sydney in this Territory, Missionary, my Justice to keep His Majesty's peace in and over the Island of Taheite, otherwise called Otaheite, and the islands adjacent, and for the preservation thereof and the quiet rule and government of His Majesty's people within the said Islands.
Given under my hand and seal at Government House, Sydney, this eighteenth day of September, 1811.

Oath
I William Henry of Sydney in this Territory, Missionary, Do Swear that, as a Justice of the Peace in the said islands, in all articles as a Justice of the Peace, I will do equal right to the poor and the rich after my cunning, wit and power, and after the laws and customs of the realm and statutes thereof made. And I will not be of council of any quarrell, hanging before me; and that I hold sessions after the form of the statutes hereof made, and the issues, fines and amerciaments, that shall happen to be made, and all forfeitures, which shall fall before me, I will cause to be entered without any concealment or embezzling, and truly send them to the King's Exchequer in this Territory. I will not let for gift or other cause, but well and truly do my office of Justice of the Peace in that behalf; and that I will take nothing for my office of Justice of the Peace to be done, but of the King and fees accustomed and costs limited by statute; and I will not direct or cause to be directed any warrant (to be made) to the parties, but direct them to the Provost Marshal of this Territory, or other the King's Officers or Ministers, or other indifferent persons to do execution thereof.
So help me God.
Wm. Henry
Sworn before me His Majesty's Judge Advocate in and for the Territory of New South Wales, this eighteenth day of September, 1811.
