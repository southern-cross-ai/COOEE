Hailey had read several passages of Scripture to him on the way, to which the Criminal paid much attention, but afterwards upbraided him in harsh terms, declaring that he had not assisted in concealing the cask found in the cooper-age, (the circumstances of which are stated in the trial of the prisoner in our last week's paper). When arrived at the awful Spot, the prisoner got out of the cart, and was received by the Rev. Mr. Marsden, who had attended him while under sentence, and who now emphatically performed the duties of his function. Jillet again ascended the cart, and, after he had been delivered over to the executioner, his Reprieve was received, and published by the Provost Marshal. Convulsed with unspeakable joy and gratitude, for so unexpected an extension of mercy, he fell motionless, and for some moments continued in a state of insensibility; when he recovered, he was taken back to his late confinement.
James Hailey, late cooper at His Majesty's Stores, now heard his sentence read, in pursuance of which, he received 200 lashes under the gallows; an example, by which we earnestly trust others may be deterred from the commission of such offences.  
The Store attendants at Sydney, Parramatta, Castle-Hill, and Hawkesbury, were indiscriminately ordered to attend on the occasion, to be spectators of the punishment.
