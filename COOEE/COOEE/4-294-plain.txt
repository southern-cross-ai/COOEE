About 5 years ago I heard from him; he was at a place in the north west of Queensland about 2,000 miles from here. If I remember right it was the Seatopa gold fields he was on at the time he wrote me. I have not heard from him since nor of him from anyone. 
I often see the Joseph of our family in the form of our oldest brother Patrick, but as he and the writer has not spoken for the past 13 years, any information that he could give me on the subject I am not likely to get, but in this case I will get a friend of mine to interview him on the subject of Willy's whereabouts. I will write to my friends in the different Queensland gold fields and see if I can find him; as soon as I can get any trace of him I will let you know at once. There is very little doubt but he is all right in some of the colonies; I suppose by this he is hitched to some of the banana women in the north or west of Queensland with a family of his own and quite forgotten that he left an old mother in the Emerald Isle to mourn his loss or to dream about his death or otherwise. However old gairl you can make yourself quite easy in your mind for he will turn up some day all right, perhaps with a big nugget in his fob and half a dozen of young Bells with him and Mrs. Bell but let us hope that she won't be black as I was very near getting hitched up to a black myself. There is nothing impossible for a colonial in the back blocks to be up to, but for fear you should think that I married a black princess or an old jin for to colonize myself, I will get Mrs. D. Quigley to send you her photo and that of my gairl, Doris Bell Quigley who was 2 and a half years and my son, so she say, Charles Banister who was 1 year and 6 months at the time the pictures were taken.  I got married in June 1889 and of course those two are the result of that union. Do you think that I got hitched up too young; of course they say that the older we get the foolisher we become. 
I have been all over the country where Willy is now, some nineteen years ago and I may be able to find him out: to advertise for him might be useless, for I have been in places where we never seen a newspaper from Christmas to the next Christmas. I am sorry to hear that you have been troubled but Burns said that man was made to mourn and I suppose he meant woman too.
