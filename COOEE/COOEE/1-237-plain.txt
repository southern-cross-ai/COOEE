Launceston, 9th September 1824. In my last I stated to you that I had drawn for £100 to enable me to purchase Hops. I trust you will honor it. My Brewery far exceeds my most sanguine expectations; in short, if I could get a regular supply of Hops, a very few years would give me a fortune far superior to what I ever possessed. I am doing so well that I am afraid to tell you for fear you would not believe me. In short, with the small means I brought out, I am even astonished myself.
The demand for my Ale is already so great that I am obliged to extend my Premises; even at present my sales are equal to 400 Hogsheads of 63 galls each a year.  All I fear is being in want of Hops.
I assure you once more that I am in a fair way to make a very rapid fortune, and only want a little assistance for the present. After this year I fully expect to able to pay off all I owe, as I do not estimate my profits this year at less than £1500, and I consider that the property I possess in the Colony well worth £2000. I have got a most desirable grant of 1000 acres, with a reserve of 500; and 2000 acres for you beside me, and 700 for Capt. Crear on the other; all on the banks of the South Eek. Besides this I have 400 acres within half a mile of Launceston, on the River Tamar, opposite where the vessels lay in port. This I purchased for £112, and I could now get for it £350; but in a year or two, I have no doubt, it will be worth twice that sum.
I have engaged a young man who has had charge of a very large Brewery in Scotland; he perfectly understands his business. In short, there is proof of it, for we cannot brew it fast enough for the demand. I charge six pounds five shillings, or 25 Dollars, for 63 galls, and for any smaller quantity 2 / 6 p. gallon. I assure you that I frequently feel astonished at my great success, so much so that I scarcely fancy it can be real. I have gut my cottage nearly finished, and am now building an additional Malt Barn, with a Granary over it, 60 feet long by 20 wide. All I want are the Boilers and constant sup of Hops, and I do not fear selling a thousand Hogs-heads a year. The Ale we brew is so much superior to what the warm climate of Sydney will enable them to brew, that, independent of the demand here, any quantity would sell there. In short, I have already refused two orders, not being able to do more than supply my customers here. Keep all this to yourself whatever you do; for at present I have no competition, and I do all I can to make it appear an unprofitable concern.
If I do not write you so often as you could wish, you must excuse it; for I assure you I have not a moment's time. It is said from the Governor to the lowest person in the Island that no person ever did so much in the same time as I have done, especially when they acquainted with my slender means. However, I now consider myself so firmly established that should you come out (which I more than expect you will).  I know you will not be a little gratified by the reception I shall be enabled to give. I am delighted with the Country, and the Society at Launceston is very good; there are six or eight families that I could dine with every day if I chose; but I never go out but on Sundays. I visit none but the very first people, and dine frequently with the Commandant. At present no person's Credit can stand higher than mine does here, and will continue to do so, provided the two Bills I have drawn on you are paid. If they are dishonored I shall suffer most dreadfully; but, from your kind assurances to me, I feel confident you will not allow my Credit to be ruined for so small a sum.
Lieut. Kenworthy and myself continue most intimate friends, and he has been a friend indeed to me; in short, without his Interest I could have done no good. If you can pay Mrs. K. any attention, pray do so on my acct., for her son's intimacy has been worth at least £1000 to me.
