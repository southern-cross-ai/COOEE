Although eighteen years have passed since the foundation of this Colony, the Blacks in the immediate vicinity of Port Jackson, still carry on their tribal warfare to the death.
SYDNEY, 26th January, 1806.
Yesterday, a contest nearly proved fatal to Bennelong, who in flying from an otherwise inevitable destruction received a spear in his hip. In spite of the assiduous training given to Bennelong by Governor Phillip, and his introduction to civilizing habits, during his visit to England, Bennelong still remains the compleat savage, given over to intemperance.
The recontre yesterday, was for the purpose of inflicting punishment on Blowit, the murderer of Musquito, and on little Pigeon likewise, who had taken an active part against the deceased.
Their assailants were Bennelong, Cathai Cole-by, Nanbury, Wilhamanan, and old White: a spear from the latter of whom striking the upper area of Blow it's shield, carried away the wood, and penetrated in a descending direction, nearly about an inch below the left eye through the nose, making a ghastly wound. Nearly at the same instant Pigeon received a spear through the leg.
Friends of these unfortunates were near at hand and Colinjong, likewise esteemed for his friendly disposition towards his European acquaintances, advanced with a poised spear towards Bennelong. At the instant he was about to throw, he received a barbed weapon in the breast from Nanbury, who was concealed in a thicket. In a few seconds Colinjong expired and Nanbury and Coleby immediately fled; but Bennelong also pursuing the same course was overtaken by his adversaries, two attacking from the front and two pressing in from behind. Those in front at length obliged him to stand, and he Scarcely warded off their spears, when turning with surprising agility he caught also the spears from his two hindmost opponents.
Numbers were now coming up to assault him: flight was his only hope of security, and how he Contrived to escape with a single wound was a matter of astonishment to all present.
The remainder of the evening was devoted to the funeral rites of poor Colinjong, who, it is believed will be interred today, in one of the bays near Woola-Moola.
It will be recalled, that on Thursday the day after Christmas last, a desperate contest also took place among the natives, when the opposing tribes from Broken Bay, and that living between Sydney and Botany Bay, made battle near the Military Barracks. The cause of the dispute was the latest love affair of Wilhamanan, a native remarkable for his manly courage, as well as for his outrageous manners, and who recently succeeded in taking away by force the wife of a native of the Broken Bay tribe.
For a long time, the warriors were prevented from conducting their war by the curiosity of the crowds of spectators, including most of the soldiers of the New South Wales Corps, who pressed in upon all sides. But as several Officers and Gentlemen commanded that no interruption or interference should be offered to their customs, the battle shortly after commenced, and in a few seconds, the field groaned beneath the weight of numbers falling under the waddy, whose aperient powers furnished in a twinkling of an eyelid, an unpleasant spectacle of fractured heads and half-expiring veterans.
In the initial shower of spears, which the combatants dodged with great dexterity, a private of the New South Wales Corps received one by accident in the foot.
Their mode of assault and defence with the waddy is certainly entitled to remark: for notwithstanding the most violent rage and impetuosity, yet the head is the only part guarded; every other part of the body being left open to the blow of the antagonist, who never avails himself of the advantage, but hammers at the head of him who endeavours to confer a lasting obligation on his own. The contest was truly spirited while it lasted.
