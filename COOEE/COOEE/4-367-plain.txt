Military Staff Office,
Adelaide, 2nd Nov., 1896.
From Col. J. M. Gordon,
Late Royal Artillery, Commandant S.A. Military Forces.
To the Organising Secretary,
People's Federal Convention, Bathurst.
Sir, - 
I have just received the kind invitation of the President of the Bathurst Federation League to be present at the Federal Convention on my return from Sydney. Much as I would like to be present thereat, I regret that my official duties in connection with the re-organisation of the South Australian Military Forces under my command, prevents my being able to spare the time to avail myself of the very kind invitation extended to me. Putting aside the political aspects of Federation, upon which it is not in my province to touch, I need hardly say that no one is more alive than myself to the necessity for Federal action in defence matters, and I trust that this important point may be given a most conspicuous place in your deliberations.
Wishing the Bathurst Federation League all success in their undertaking,
I have the honor to be,
Yours faithfully,
JOSEPH M. GORDON,
Col. Commandant S.A. Military Forces.
