At a public meeting of the colonists, held at the Exchange, King William-street, Adelaide - Charles B. Newenham, Esq, sheriff, in the chair, the following resolutions were unanimously agreed to: - Proposed by J. H. Fisher, Esq, seconded by G. S. Kingston, Esq. - 1st. That the Bill laid before Parliament, entitled "A Bill for the better government of Her Majesty's Australian Colonies," so far as it relates to the colony of South Australia, meets the wishes and wants of the colonists in most of its most essential provisions; and by recommending the concession of a Representative Government with such extensive powers, deserves to be regarded as a wise,. liberal, and comprehensive measure; and that the thanks of the colonists are due to the Right Hon. Earl Grey, Secretary for the Colonies, and to Mr. Hawes, Lord John Russell, and Mr. Labouchere, the members of the House of Commons who prepared and brought in the Bill. 
Proposed by Samuel Davenport, Esq, and seconded by George Elder Esq. - 2nd. That the formation of a General Assembly of the Australasian colonies, however desirable on the majority of matters proposed to be left to the decision of such Assembly, is in principle as in form a Federal Union; is, in a British sense, unconstitutional, as morally opposed to the social institution of the colony, and endangering our colonial independence.
Proposed by G. A. Anstey, Esq, and seconded by A. H. Davis Esq. - 3rd. That the resolutions recently passed by the Legislative Council, recommending a second chamber, do not represent the opinion nor convey the sentiment of the colonists, particularly as the proposed Act confers all needful powers for amending the constitution, and adapting it to future exigencies; and that any provision which should enforce upon the colonists a system of life nominees in such a Chamber, this meeting deprecates as an intolerable evil, which might neutralize all the good to be anticipated from the proposed measure.
Proposed by F. S. Dutton, Esq, and seconded by G. M. Waterhouse, Esq. - 4th. The colonists being prepared as heretofore to bear the whole expenses of their civil government, consider that they have a constitutional right to regulate, by means of their representatives in Council, the mode of raising and of appropriating the colonial revenue, free from all direction and control by Her Majesty's Treasury, or by the Commissioners of Customs; and they further consider that the Local Government should have the power of appointing all officers of government, and that the salaries should be fixed by the Colonial Legislature.
Proposed by J. B. Montefiore, Esq, and seconded by Wm. Peacock, Esq. - 5th. That this meeting considers the provisions in the Sydney Act, fixing the qualifications of members of the proposed Representative Council, and of the electors, inapplicable to the circumstances of the colony; and that power should be therefore given to the Local Legislature to qualify such provisions as they may see fit. 
Proposed by Wm. Blyth, Esq, and seconded by Samuel Stocks, Esq. - 6th. That a copy of the resolutions passed at this meeting, and signed by the chairman, be forwarded to Earl Grey; and that the following gentlemen be appointed a committee, with power to add to their number, to prepare petitions to both Houses of Parliament embodying these resolutions, requesting His Excellency the Lieutenant-Governor to forward the same with the least possible delay.
