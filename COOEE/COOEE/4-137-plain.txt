 I was very sorry to see by Mary's letter that things look so bad at home. It has ever been Hugh and my great  to try and take up some land with the hope of bettering our position and perhaps opening a way for you all out here seeing things do not improve at home but unfortunately it has not been our luck. It requires capital and we have not that at our disposal owing to ill-health and other disappointments but we hope ere next year to be able to take up an allotment so as to enable us to establish bee - farming on a very extensive scale to which could be added other industries
