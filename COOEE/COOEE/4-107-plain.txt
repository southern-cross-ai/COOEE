However it happened that I held on to my purpose and the bees have done better under my own separate care than when he was with me. There is a man in Kew who was talking to me today.

 You will be surprised to know that Oscar Amey departed this life on the 20th at the Alfred Hospital Melbourne (South) he died of typhoid fever and congestion of the lungs. Linch (Kitchen's gardner) Fraser and I undertook to bury him in Kew cemetery in a private grave, the deeds of which will be sent home to his father. It will cost me about Â£1. He was buried on Tuesday last.
