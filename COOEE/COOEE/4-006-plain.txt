I am sorry to say that there is no chance of gold now about where I lives yet I hope I will come on a patch some day unexpectedly. I am almost the only alluvial miner seen at work with a deal of patience. It is not known, as soon as all the gold is swallowed of these diggings, what the people will do. We must have to work for a living whilst life lasts.
