June 1872
My dear Miss Lewin, At the risk of again incurring your anger I write once more to you. When this reaches you, I shall have sailed (D.V.) for England, and I do not think even you would blame me under the circumstances, did you know what life in Australia for a Governess is - its sense of intense loneliness and unprotectedness - utter friendlessness. All whom I have met in the same position reiterate what I write. I have saved sufficient money to take me back 2nd Class, would have had more, but sent money home. I would most willingly go as a Nursery Governess, children or teaching is no trouble to me - I do teach French & Music. I enclose you a testimonial from Mrs Scott. It is a favourable one, & without boasting, she could not have done less, but my life there was a difficult one in every respect.
How deeply grieved have I been in having left England, the intense selfishness of all classes, the great want of intellect, & in so many cases the utter want of truth, straightforwardness & frankness is most trying. The great expenses of everything, travelling especially, often hundreds of miles by Coach, constitution & purse suffer alike. 
Will my appeal be in vain this time, or will you still say you will not help me? I am so unhappy, for my family are very poor, & I am wretched out here alone. Granted that I should have weighed all this before leaving home, still I could not foresee much that has occurred, & I was sanguine thinking that I could battle against everything. If you would kindly help me! and you have so much influence! May I ask if it were possible for me to obtain employment in London, in the City, I dont care where. It has always been to me such a wonderful place.
I have been since I left the Scotts in a School in Tasmania, into the detail of which I need not enter, the Principal (lady) as is usual with Bush ladies, no mind or thought, and in consequence is fast losing her Pupils. Hoping you will kindly think me over & not too severely.
I remain
Yours sincerely
Rosa Payne
