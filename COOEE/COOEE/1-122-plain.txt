My dear Sir
I am pursuaded you will be glad to hear of our safe arrival in New South Wales after a very pleasant passage of twenty weeks at sea. I was much astonished to find Governor Bligh still in the Colony and the 102nd Regt containing many of my old friends. We met with a very kind reception from the inhabitants in general. They expressed much pleasure at our return, many had been great sufferers during the Revolution. I believe both parties will have little more than vexation Trouble and expense. The Colony at large has been much injured and its prosperity checked. It will require some time to recover so very severe a shock The only thing that has apparently increased during my absence is the horned cattle.  Notwithstanding the great slaughter that has been made they are become very numerous. Fine beef is now sold to Government for victualling the Troops at nine-pence per lb and will in a short time be much less. It is the finest Country in the world for Cattle, my stock has done well in my absence, and all my servants have behaved well. I found them all as I left them excepting one man. I think this is very much to the credit of men who are or have been convicts, that such a number of them should do their duty for three years without their masters eye. I am also happy to inform you that I have got in a very fine state the Gooseberry currant and vine. I also took out two hives of Bees from Rio and got them out safe but am afraid that many of them are dead since. I have had so much to attend to since we landed that I really forgot them and left them in the Governors garden, where I fear the heavy rains have injured them. I took five Spanish sheep from Portsmouth which I received as a present from his Majesty, four of these I landed safe and two lambs. I think I have been exceeding fortunate in all these valuable things. Many more useful things I have collected and have introduced into the Colony. Every little adds to our stock. I hope the settlement will now have a little quiet and then it will get on well. Money is very scarce in the settlement. The Revolution has checked Agriculture so much that there is not grain sufficient grown for the support of the Inhabitants so that we are compelled to send to India for wheat.
Hassall I find has only remitted one Hundred pounds for the goods which were sent to him and that in a private Bill. This Bill may be paid and I hope it will as the woman who is in this Country had considerable property in England as her uncle informed me whom I saw at Woolwich and who called upon me about her, but I do not like private Bills. I shall endeavour to get Hassall to remit the remainder in Government money.
The Revolution has injured the colony much and almost ruined many. It has been a means of preventing Hassall getting Government bills, as the Bills drawn by those who had usurped the Government were not considered good.  I am sorry for your disappointment but you need not be under any apprehension of losing the money.
Mr. Oaks the bearer of this will give you any further information you may wish. Mr. Oaks was head constable here and is ordered home as an evidence upon the arrest of the late Governor Bligh and will return again when that business is settled. Mr. M unites with me in kind remembrances to Mr. Stokes Mrs. and Mr. Hughes and all your family.
I am
Dear Sir
Yours much obliged
SAMUEL MARSDEN.
