When I come to think of it it seems a risky undertaking for one with so little experience as myself to undertake to manage and bring a station, in a state of utter disorder, into good order. I have scarcely had one year's experience but if close attention to it and hard work will do anything towards making it pay it shall not be lacking on my part. And I am the more encouraged when I think it is not myself alone I am working for but for the dearest girl living. Oh Lillie my own true love I would undergo anything for your sweet sake and count it but pleasure if it but brought you the nearer to me. I often think what would life be to me now without the love of my Lillie. I managed to get along in a kind of a way before but now it would be misery indeed. Tis the sweetest thought I have that before long I hope to take you to myself for better, there will be no worse in it.  Sure there won't. Do tell me more about yourself in your letters. Fill them up about Lillie, commence with Lillie, end with Lillie, and fill the space between with the same subject, and you may add a postscript about her too, it will not be too much. It is a subject I never weary reading about, writing about, or speaking about, so satisfy me in this respect my little girl. I am looking as if I had just escaped from prison, my hair cut close and my beard also. I do wish I could make my mustache grow a bit longer. It sticks at the one length much to my disgust. Is not this vanity worse than a girl, I fancy I can hear you say. Perhaps by the time you see me next it may have stretched a little and you may not be able to get at my lips. How will that do?
