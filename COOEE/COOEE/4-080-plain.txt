I think the money would be better laid out here on a bit of good land than to buy a farm at home and still have to pay a rent for it. A man to select in this country would have more he could call his own in 10 years than he would have in 20 at home. I am quite sure. I see evidence everywhere I go. There is still land to select and under not more difficulties than in earlier times. Mr Barron used to have to cart wheat from here to Melbourne before the railway was made up this far.
