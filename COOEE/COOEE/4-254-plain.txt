The boys did not know whether my name would do as they might have to send one paper for you to sign. Of course I told the boys that I did not want anything off the land as I thought Hugh had a right to all that was in John's name. The land was taken out in John's name but in reality they were partners, Hugh giving money and John labour and experience. 
We settled for them to keep the land for another year and appoint Bob Wilson as agent to look after some fencing, letting of grass selling cattle and horses etc for which he is to be paid a percentage. I also gave him power to sell Sarah's block and mine as I have not the heart to go there now since John's decease. We would have been there before this only waiting to gather a little money together before we could go as the boys had all we had before this. However if we had known there was anything the matter or that John was in delicate health we surely would have been there. I am extremely sorry that I did not spend my holidays with John instead of going to the river but was keeping the money to send to him.
