What is come over you for the past two or three weeks, you have not come to see me just before I go to sleep as you generally do, is it because I go to bed so early about 7 or 8 sometimes or what is the reason? Be what it may, I miss you very much and wish you would maintain your loving visits, the only drawback to them is just as I fancy it is really yourself and can almost feel you and clasp you in my arms, either you fade away or I sink into the arms of death's twin sister. Oh my little girl how I long to have you with me never to leave me again. How I long to have you stroke my hair once more, to smooth the furrows in my brow and as you turn your face up toward mine and display that tempting little rosebuds to press it again and again
