My dearest Papa,
It was with great joy I saw a letter in your handwriting on the mantlepiece on my arrival here this morning. I immediately broke open the seal and perused the contents. After many a weary day of expectation I learned you had heard from me at last and I hope my dearest Papa you will be pleased to hear from me again once a year as long as you live. I must not give up the privilege as long as you will permit it of sending you a few lines and will restrict myself to that period to guard against wearying and offending you. Alas! There is more of my trash on its way to you, it cannot be recalled and I only regret it in case of wounding and inconveniencing you afresh, but as our better star is prevailing I thought my relation of passing events would carry balm with it to one so much interested in our well-doing as yourself.
Matilda and I have come down to Perth as her Papa is tired of being without us. he got leave from the Government to spend Xmas with his family at Grass Dale and has driven us down.  We proceed to Fremantle on the 1st of January, the new Colonial Secretary having come out. Kenneth is at Champion Bay, the rest of the children at Grass Dale. I had an invitation to a grand Ball at Govt. House on the 23rd. of December but declined going as it would have broken up our Xmas family party at home, though Mr. Brown thinking to gratify me had gone to the expense of a suitable dress and all the etceteras for the occasion which would have been displayed at another gala no less brilliant given by a fashionable lady in Perth but having no spirits left I have written to decline the invitation. There is more I could say but will restrict myself and leave the remaining space for a more valued correspondent.
Pray dearest Papa send me those unworthy annals, they have one redeeming merit, that of being faithful and will be useful to me as documents from which to cull reminiscences of a settler's life which in after years may possess some interest for my children. When the calamity befals me of having no more my dearest Father to write to one of my Sisters must bear the burden of hearing from  once a year. I promise only a single letter. If a parent cannot bear with my infirmity how can I expect any one less bound by kindred ties to listen with interest to the outpourings of my heart in its search for sympathy, tedious descriptions and labours in vain for that is the light in which I now regard those unfortunate productions.
