 in the same place at St Patricks, he told us he saw a Priest drop dead & afterwards saw the Blessd Virgin walk towards him taking him by the hand & raised him to life. Before he got bad at all Kate one night saw her mother in a dream, she thought she had a few angry words with her. Then your mother went straight into the room where he stept, stooped over him & Kissed him. Ever afterwards he was not well. 
My Poor Johnev's last words were Mother you Keep my watch & dont be crying. He was so very fond of his Mother that he Could not bear her to be away from him one minute. So now we feel sad & lonley after him, my life is a misery to me & to his Poor mother after his nineteen years & three months. His name was John Laurence because he was very near twelve months before being baptised & Kate was always saying he had a head like you & truly it was so, & therefore his name. On yesterday Sunday we laid some flowers on his grave, & shed some silent tears over him who was loved by all that Knew him. You will let Poor Father & sister Know of our sad loss. 
John was telling me Poor Tom Quirk died. Poor Fellow many a happy day we spent together. Give our fond love to Mrs & Family. I would like to say more but cant for the present. Yours fondly
