"MY DEAREST ADA- Another year is drawing to its close, and it brings with it, for me, one only joy,-the hope that I shall, ere long, see another of my beloved's children. God bless you, dearest, and bring you as gently through your trial as may be, and grant you a mother's happiness through all its depths. Politics here, Ada, are very disheartening and very disgusting. Mr. Flood is about to retire, and Dalley talks of resigning. I expect to hear in a few days, or weeks at furthest, Mr. Murray's resignation of his office, perhaps of his seat. There has been a great 'torchlight' meeting here lately, to consider the Land Bill. Do not make images for yourself of a myriad flambeaux throwing their shadows and their glare upon thousands of upturned faces. There were a couple of dim, very dim lights fixed to the poles of the platform, and that was the whole strength of the illumination. 
"But the fun was that all Members of the Assembly, good, bad, and indifferent, were roundly abused by the various speakers-coming men, orators in train, that nobody ever heard of before, and whom nobody seems to know, except Mr. Henry Parkes, who is at the bottom of the whole thing. The affair has amused me greatly. 'Dalley,' said one of the gushing orators, "is turning into a petrifaction, and little Deniehy is too spiritual, too refined, too far up in the clouds to care about the people's wants.' Now the best of the joke is, that I, in connection with Robertson, before any of these humbug meetings were held, moved, and we are now endeavouring to have inserted in the Bill, the very provisions these poor wretches spouting by the light of a tallow candle in the open air are clamouring for, the right of selection before survey, deferred payments, and rule for residence and cultivation. 
"Adieu, my love, the end of next week will see me home. 
"D. H. DENIEHY."
