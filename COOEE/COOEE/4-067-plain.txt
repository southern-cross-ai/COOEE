He was helping to put up some fences as he must know how to tighten the wire before he can be a boundary-rider. He says that Queensland is much ruffer country than Victoria as much as Victoria is ruffer than home, some of the roads in the bush being very bad and no stones on them. He describes them as like the moss roads.
