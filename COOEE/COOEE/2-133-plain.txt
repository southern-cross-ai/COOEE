His Majesty's Government having authorised the location of Settlers on the vacant Crown Lands adjacent to the shores of Port Phillip under the same Regulations as are now in force for the alienation of Crown Lands in other parts of New South Wales, and several persons having already passed over there from Van Diemen's Land, His Excellency the Governor has been pleased to appoint Captain WILLIAM LONSDALE, of the 4th, or King's Own Regiment, to be Police Magistrate for that district, of which all persons concerned are hereby required to take notice.
Arrangements are in progress for effecting the Survey and Measurement of such parts of the Land near Port Phillip as it may be expedient to dispose of in time first instance; but until the same have been completed, of which due notice will he given, no applications for purchase can he entertained. In the mean time, it is distinctly to be understood by those persons who may be desirous of resorting to Port Phillip from other parts of New South Wales, or from Van Diemen's Land, that no advantage will be obtained by the occupation of any land at that place previously to its conveyance of a legal instrument from the Government of New South Wales, as without such title the land (unless required for public purposes) will be subject to be put up for competition at a Public Sale, and sold to the best bidder.
By H is Excellency's Command,
ALEXANDER McLEAY.
