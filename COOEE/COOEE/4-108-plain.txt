I am at present at work in a nursery about a mile and a half from here and as I work by the day I start work at 8 every morning and knock off at 6 - one hour too long but as I am going to work in a neighbouring nursery in about ten days or when I have done where I am at present, I will work only till five. I have 6s. a day. In the spring I will be able to get 6s. 6d. or 7s. Last week I got 2s. 6d. more than my wages so you see I am able to do my work 
I intend going into the bees next spring with all the capital I can muster and give it a good trial. It will likely to be some part of Gippsland which I will select for the apiary. I would like to establish about 50 or 60 hives. The 14 which I have got will give off a good swarm each next spring which will mean 28 and with purchasing all the swarms I could get in the district I could likely raise the remainder. 
Had Amey done right we ought to have had 50 now but he acted the rogue and the worse for himself for had he remained about a healthy place like Kew he would not have caught the fever.
