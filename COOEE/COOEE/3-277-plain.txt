I can grow the very best potatoes and vegetables I ever saw without manure. I have Indian corn growing now sixteen feet high. I have one acre of orange trees four years old loaded with fruit. In another year or so they will be worth a pound a tree annually. Also one acre orchard of all sorts of trees - We have twenty head of cattle and five horses and fifteen large pigs and mother keeps one hundred fowls  We are doing very well for we have good crops and a good stock and everything we can wish for and a good bit of money in the bank also. We don't regret leaving old Ireland for this is a very good country for steady industrious people though it is not near so good as it was some years ago.
