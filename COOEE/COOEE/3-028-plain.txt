My Dear Eliza,
I received your letter of the 9th and 10th with more than usual pleasure as it was very apparent from the whole tenor of your letter that you had been relieved from very considerable anxiety by getting Thomson and party fairly away. Aubrey is also no doubt glad and I trust Thomson will be successful.
I need not say how flattering it is to my vanity to find you are desirous I should be at Home at Christmas particularly as it chimes in so cordially with my own wishes. As yet I do not see how I can get away but it is an old saying that "where there is a will there is a way," and it is possible I may get some kind friend or other to take my duties for two days, but I shall not like to ask Mr. Mackie again as it is more than he ought to undertake. He has acted once for me with so much cordiality and received me on my return with such a hearty welcome that it would be unkind to ask him. I dine tonight with Mr. Symmons at 7 oclock, he is very kind and obliging whenever I want a 2nd Magistrate and is most likely to oblige me at Christmas.
I am also about to bring Elliot Lt. 99th J.P upon the bench as soon and as often as I can as it is necessary to have more than one who will feel inclined to assist in case of necessity. Poor fellow he had a heavy fall while dancing the other night at Capt. Bruce's with Mrs. Knight. She shared the same fate. The party was a pleasant one and dancing kept up until "day in the morning". The party was given in honor of the Bride and Bridegroom Mr and Mrs Galbraith. Mr and Mrs Smith were there also, after supper the Comptroller General called for all to fill a bumper to the health of the Brides and Bridegrooms. Galbraith in an easy and jocose manner animadverted upon the pleasures, delights and true happiness of matrimony and urged his bachelor friends to go and do likewise. Mr. Smith was not so fortunate in his speech, talked of having met his fate but whether for happiness or misery chance or time would determine. Mrs. Mends is a fine woman fond of dancing and kept the Comptroller very considerably under control the whole evening. Mrs. Henderson is gentle and ladylike.
I tried all over the Town last night to get you a bonnet cap for mourning but without success. Mrs. Cowan has promised me to get one made for you today by some of the dress makers for which I will pay. The gloves I hope to get this morning.
Your poor Father must be very lonely. His letter to both you and me is very kind and more than we ought to expect of him. I wish we were near him that we might endeavour to aleviate his sorrows.  I have been twice to the Post office to find out when the mail was delivered in London which conveyed our letters of January last. You will recollect it was just before the 1st. of January that I put them into the Post office here and your Father's letter to us is dated April 11, and it is possible the ship did not sail from this for some weeks after the letters were put into the office, and that the letters were not delivered which went by that mail when your father wrote, but I am promised every information at 11 oclock today, and I shall let you know particulars.
Yours very affectionately
Thos Brown
I shall write to Charles Messingham to get him if possible to put up the little house at the bottom of the garden and put up the fence which was washed down by the flood, after this is done Filly and Pony would do well in the paddock for some time when the hay is carried. I promised Chas. Smith another cask, he may have the one in the hail or any of those in the store room. Those in the store room are small but strong and good.
Shenton gives 50 per cent on the amount or cost price, so that if we should think it necessary to purchase an allottment at Fremantle we can.
I have sold to Shenton goods cost in England 26.19.0 and kept for the men goods value 7.3.0 - 34.2.0
Mr. Lukin is appointed Land Valuator at a salary of £200 per annum and forage allowance for one horse. Fred. Wittenoom is appointed Sheriff and Emigration agent salary £200 Geo Stone to be Crown Solicitor salary £200.
Friday - I have seen the cap which Mrs Cowan got made and think you will like it. Price 3 / 6. If you send me down the invoice perhaps I could explain it to you T.B.
Mr and Mrs De Burgh called last night, she is now living at a very small place betwixt Twines and Viveash's. She is on the look out for a  Burgh goes back to attend to stock and bring down furniture. Friday mg. George Leake has arrived yesterday, but I have not seen him. I do not think you will have the Governor next week.
Was the young colt which was lame able to go with the herd and did Thomson take De Burgh's foal with him or was it shut up until he got away from the district? How does the Pony and foal get on, did Thomson take the plastering trowell?
