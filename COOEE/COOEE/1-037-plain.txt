A most atrocious murder was committed by persons unknown on the body of one Lewis, he was supposed to be worth some money which he allways carried about him, he was found buried under some wood, his throat cut and two stabs in  is side. 11 Sultry, Wind North. 12 o. Wind North, about 4 o' lock in the afternoon the wind changed to the S E, a heavy rain came on with thunder and lightening, and an instantaneous gale of wind the heavyest I ever experienced, it tore trees up by the roots, unrooft many houses, among others my own, and I am much afraid we shall hear of accidents happening to some of the boats going to Sydney, it held up for some short time but the rain, thunder and lightening came on again about 8 o'clock, and continued with intervals the whole night.
13 Showers, Wind East. It appears that he heavy gale of wind which came on the 12 was partial and came in a column, its course was N E to N W. 14 Showers, hard rain in the Night with heavy wind at S E. 15 Cloudy with wind at S E. rain in the Evng. 16 Rain high wind from S E. which continued the whole night. 17 Heavy rain from the S E. 18. Fine warm weather. Wind N W. 19 Hott wind Do. it appears from general observation that the rain comes from the S E or S W (rarely tho' sometimes from N E) and the hott weather from W. NW &c. 20 Hott wind N W. 21 Do. Do.
22 Do. Do. 23 Cloudy. Wind S E. 24 Sultry. Wind West. 25 Excessive Hott. Wind West. The Ration this week 8 lb Wheat and 3 pound of Pork. one half of the wheat at the settlement expended. 26 Hott.

Wind South. 30 Sultry with Showers Wind East. Crimes multiply fast punishment seems to have little effect with the most part. Some preventative orders which had been given out by The Govr Phillips were suffer'd to grow obsolete wh. in my opinion is one great cause of the present multiplicity of crimes; the Freemen have had to great liberty, and have in many instances been the receivers of stolen goods. -- 31 Sultry at times, and cloudy wind East.
Feby. 1 Cloudy, Wind East. 2 Showers Wind S E. 3 Cloudy Wind N W. 4 Sultry Wind Do. 5 Excessive Hott. This is the hottest time of the year. Wind East. 6 Hot and cloudy Wind South. Our stores diminish fast, there is not more than a months provision (salt meat) in the store, what means will be taken to provide the convicts with a ration in case of no ship coming, is yet unknown. 7 Showers with heat. Wind West. God Almighty has been very bountiful to us in giving us such fine refreshing showers, which will secure to us a good crop of Indian Corn, of the greatest consequence to us, when we have every reason to believe that little or no assistance will be given us from Europe. and it is much to be feared that the Shaw Hamauzur will fail us, as her time is expired. 8 Hott. Wind East. The Ration the same as before. 9 Excessive Hott. Wind N W. Thunder, lightening and rain from the S E. Hott . Wind 10 Hott. Wind East. 11 Hott. Wind N W. a Woman coming from Prospect hill was speared by the Natives. 
Eight men absconded from the Settlement and are gone into the woods, most probably for the purpose of robbing the Settlers. and this day 7 more from this place likewise absconded, but were taken attempting to take a boat away. they are all Irish that came out either in the Bodington or Sugar cane. 12 Excessive Hott. Wind West. Rain much wanted. 13. Yesterday at 2 o'clock the Sloop from Norfolk Island arrived at Sydney, and Officer and a party of soldiers came in her, we are not yet acquainted with the reason. There is now only 3 weeks ration of Wheat and meat in store. Cloudy and Hott Wind East. 14 Cloudy and Hott. Wind N E. Yesterday went to Toongabbe for the first time these 12 months. The Crop of Indian Corn looks well. This day two years the Pitt arrived. 15 Some rain in the morning from the S W but the wind shifting to the N W it cleared up and became excessive hott. We have very favourable accounts of the crops at Norfolk Island, Wheat is so low as 5s / pr Bushell and Indian Corn at 2s / 6d, from forty to Sixty and even 80 Bushells were not uncomon. 16 Hott Wind East. 17 Hott.

21 Cloudy and Hott. Wind S E. 22 Cloudy Wind East. There appears to be a very great difference of opinion with regard to the Government of this country and its dependencies between Grs. G. and K. tho' in my opinion there ought to be but one, for without all about it is a civil Government, and the military are subordinate to it, but this is not the prevailing opinion with those who have now the power. The Magistrates are laid aside, a civil court has never been called since Govr. P left us, &c. and altho' the act passed for the Establisshment of this colony, says "Now are in all things to conform as nearly to the constitution of England as circumstances will admit" yet the reverse is followed. 23 Small showers. Wind S E. 24 Fine Showers for most of the day Wind S E. 25 Cloudy in the morning, and Hott. Wind West. 26 Went down to Sydney, ship sailed for Norfolk, Cloudy Wind East. 27. Cloudy, went with Major to his farm, the buildings about the farmyard and the whole together more like and English farm than any I have seen. 28.

Cold. the hot weather appears to be gone. 7. Cool. Wind South a gentle Shower for about an hour. 8 Ration 4 ld Wheat 6 ld I. Corn and 2 ld Pork, of which there is no more in the Store, The Wheat is likewise out, and the seed Wheat must be served, it takes about 450 Bushells weekly. 9 This day we got an account of a Ship being in sight, providence sent us it just in time, as it will be the means of saving the seed wheat. 10 The Ship was blown off, we are still ignorant of what she is. 11. The Ship call'd the William came in from England laden with Beef and Pork, Iron: &c. but unfortunately no Flower Wh. is much wanted. She brings us accounts of Govr. Phillips
unworthy of their attachment; and if their gracious parent, is pleased to consider its term as sufficient for trial, they are feelingly convinced that it is sufficient for enjoyment.
Who is it then that, favoured with the glorious gospel of the blessed God, reproaches his creator for making his life as it were a span long? It is the worldly minded and the wicked, whose projects of criminal aggrandisement are disconcerted by the rapid advance of death, and whose expectations are to perish in the grave. It is the thoughtless and the licentious who (miserable error!) deem the great business of man to be amusement, and who complain with inconsistent propriety, if I may hazard the expression, of the tediousness of hours and of the fleetness of Life.
-- The being who indulges useless sorrow, instead of fulfilling the duties of life, may claim our pity, but should never excite admiration, for in such characters there is no true greatness of soul, or just sentiments of religion; indeed this kind of sorrow is rather the offspring of romantic notions and false refinements, than of sensibility, and a nice sense of duty.
-- Distinguish with exactness, in thyself and others, between wishes and will in the strictest sense - who has many wishes has generally but little will. Who has energy of will has few diverging wishes. Whose will is bent, with energy on one, must renounce the wishes of many things. Who cannot do this, is not stamped with the majesty of human nature. The energy of choise, the unison of various powers for one is only will, born under the agonies of self-denial and renounced desires.
Sagacity in selecting the good, and courage to honour it, according to its degree, determines your own degree of goodness. -- No wheedler loves.
Who can look quietly at nothing, can never do anything wrong of imitation.
He who has genius and eloquence sufficient either to cover, or to excuse his errors, yet extenuates not, but rather excuses himself, and unequivocally confesses guilt - approches the circle of immortals, whom human language has dignified with the appellation of Gods and saints. - Who crawling receives, will give superciliously.
There are actions, sentiments, manners, speeches; there is a silence of such magnitude energy, decision - as to be singly worth a whole life of some men. He who has these features never can act meanly - all his actions, words, writings, however to appearance ambiguous, must be stamped by their superior energy.
There are many who are much acquainted with man and little with the world, others that know the world, and are not acquainted with man. These two kinds of knowledge, mistaken for each other, occasion many unjust and precipitated decisions.. let every one, really intent on the study of mankind, avoid confounding and carefully search to unite them.- Sneers are the blasts that proceeds quarrels.
There are rapid moments of joy, and of grief, moments which every one has, at least once in his life, that illuminate his character at once.
Who in certain moments can entirely lose himself in another, and in the midst of the greatest action, thinks of no observer, is a jewel in the crown of human nature.
Who in receiving a benefit, estimates its value more closely than in conferring one shall be a citizen of a better world.
Know that the great art to love your enemy consists in never losing sight of man in him; humanity has power over all that is human; the most inhuman man still remains man, and never can throw off all taste for what becomes a man - but you must learn to wait.
The merely just can generally bear great virtues, as little as great vices.
The more there is of mind in your solitary employments, the more dignity is there in your character:- Truth, wisdom, love seek reasons. Malice only causes
He who can at all times sacrifice pleasure to duty, approaches sublimity.
Call him Saint, who can forget his own sufferings in the minute grief of others.
Trust him little who praises all, him less who censures all, and him least who is indifferent about all.
He who is master of the fittest moment to crush his enemy and neglects it is born to be a conqueror.
Save me from him who is inexaustible in evasions when he is called upon to do a good thing, and teems with excuses when he has done a bad one.
Take here the grand secret - if not of pleasing all, yet of displeasing none - court mediocrity, avoid originality, and sacrifice to fashion.
A god, an animal, a plant, are not companions of man, nor is the faultless - then judge with lenity of all; the coolest, wisest, best, all without exception, have their points, their moments of enthusiasm, fanaticism, absence of mind, faint heartedness, stupidity. - if you allow not for these, your criticisms on man will be a mass of accusations or caricatures.
Receive no satisfaction from premeditated impertinence - forget it, forgive it - but keep him inexorably at a distance who offered it.
Nature has placed mankind under the governance of two sovereign masters, pain and pleasure. It is for them alone to point out what we ought to do, as well as to determine what we shall do. On the one hand the stand of right and wrong, on the other the chain of causes and effects, are fastened to their throne. They govern us in all we do, in all we say, in all we think. Every effort we can make to throw off our subjection, will serve but to demonstrate and confirm it. In words a man may pretend to abjure their empire, but in reality he will remain subject to it all the while. The principle of utility recognizes this subjection and assumes it for the foundation of that system, the object of which is to rear the fabric of felicity by the hands of reason and of law. Systems which attempt to question it deal in sounds instead of sense, in caprice instead of reason, in darkness instead of light.
Every man has originally a right, by the gift of God, to the unrestrained enjoyment of life and personal freedom, and to such a portion of the unapropriated production of the earth as is necessary for his comfortable subsistence.
He therefore who deprives another of these gifts, or restrains him in the enjoyment of them, except such deprivation or restraint is sanctioned by divine authority, is guilty of an act of injustice to the individual and of a sin against God.
Everyman originally has authority from God to deprive another of these Gifts, or to restrain him in the enjoyment of them in the following cases and in these only.
1.When in so doing he acts according to the express comand of God.
2. When he proceeds to such deprivation and restraint so far only, as is necessary for the defence of the gifts of God to himself, or in case his assistance is desired, in the defence of the gifts of God to another, against attacks unauthorized by God.
3. When he proceeds to such deprivation or restraint in consequence of the consent of the individual suffering it.
4. Every man sins against God who either voluntarily consents to relinquish or abridge any of his natural rights, or who does not endeavour to resist, by all requisite force every unauthorized invasion of them, except he is persuaded that, by imposing the restraints in question upon himself or by submitting to the imposition of them by another, he shall no in any degree disqualify himself, from answering on the whole, the great purposes of his being. And in like manner every one sins against God who accepts from another a transfer of any of his rights, unless he is persuaded that by such acceptance he shall not in any degree disqualify the latter from answering, on the whole the great purposes of his being. 
If these propositions are satisfactorily established, they will be found to settle on solid and determinate grounds the obligations of justice in all its brances, and to afford a clear insight into the distinguishing characteristics of what moralists have usually stiled perfect and imperfect rights.
The Idea of a God, at the same distance from all men, serves to console us from that shocking superiority of rank and fortune under the oppression of which we live. It is necessary to transport ourselves to the heights religion discovers, to consider with a kind of calmness and indifference the frivolous pretensions of some, and the confident haughtiness of others; and such objects of regret or of envy, which appeared a Colossus to our imagination, are changed into a grain of sand, when we contrast them with the grand prospects which such sublime meditations display to our view.
Religion then comes continually to assist the civil legislation, it speaks a language unknown to the laws, it warms that sensibility which ought to advance even before reason, it acts like light and interior warmth, as it both enlightens and animates; and what we have not sufficiently observed, is, that in society its moral sentiments are the imperceptible tie of a number of parts, which seem to be held by their own agreement, and which would be successively detached if the chain which united them was ever to be broken.
A perfect model is necessary to fix the admiration of men, and it is only by an intercourse more or less constant with that first model, that several opinions which seem, in appearance, to arise merely from convenience, have consistency.
Every thing is replaced and firmly established by religion, it surrounds, I may say, the whole system of morality, resembling that universal and mysterious force of physical nature, which retains the planets in their orbits, and subjects them to a regular revolution; and which, in the midst of the general order it maintains, escapes the observation of men, and appears to their feeble sight, unconscious of its own work.
What a subject for glory are the endowments of the mind, when we can consider them as a participation of a sublime nature, of which God alone is the perfect model. And how delightful then to yield to the ambition of elevating ourselves still more, by exercising our thoughts, and improving all our faculties.
In short how many charms has the observation of nature, when, at every new discovery, we believe we advance a step towards an acquaintance with that exalted wisdom which has prescribed laws to the universe, and maintains it in harmony! It is then and only then, that the study is truly interesting, and the progress of knowledge becomes an increase of happiness.
And that while religion improves the understanding, it affords a solid support during the different vicissitudes of life. -- It is the friend of the oppressed, the refuge of the being, who has been unjustly or cruelly slandered, as well as the man of feeling, who is fatiuged with viewing the vices and depravity of the world.
Without these enlivening hopes where would be the enjoyment of friendship. how unite to that charm of our days the habitual image of a death without hope? It would indeed be a dream of pleasure, and we should soon wake to a keener sense of anguish; In short, the world without the Idea of God, would be only a desert embelishd by a few delusions --, Yet men, disenchanted by the light of reason, would find nothing throughout but subjects of sadness.
The most distinct characteristick of Christianity is the spirit of charity and forbearance which pervades its precepts. The ancients undoubtedly, respected the beneficent virtues; but the precept which commends the poor and the weak, to the protection of the opulent, belongs essentially to our religion. With what care, with what love the Christian legislator returns continually to the same sentiment and interest! The tenderest pity lent to his words a persuavive unction, but, I admire, above all the awful lesson he has given, in explaining the close union established between our sentiments towards the supreme being and our duties towards men. Thus, after having termed the love of God, the first commandment of of the Law, the Evangalist adds, and the second, which is like unto it, is to love thy neighbour as thyself. The second, which is like unto it! what simplicity, what extent in that expression! Can any thing be more interresting and sublime, than to offer continually to our mind the Idea of a God taking on himself the gratitude of the unfortunate? where find any principle of morality, of which the influence can ever equal such a grand thought? The poor, the miserable, however abject their state, appear surrounded with the symbol of glory, when the love of humanity becomes an expression of the sentiments which elevate us to God, and the mind ceases to be lost in the immensity of his perfections, when we hope to maintain an habitual intercourse with the supreme being, by the services which we render unto men. It is thus that a single thought spreads a new light on our duty, and gives to Metaphisical Ideas a substance comformable to our organs.
A composition is perfect, when the matter rises out of the subject, when the thoughts are agreable to the matter, and the expressions suitable to the thoughts. Where there is no inconsistency from the beginning to the end. When the whole is perspicuous in the beautiful order of its parts, and formed in due symetry and proportion.
Epitaph on Miss Cambell, of musical abilities, who excelled
in an eminent degree on the pedal-harp.
O' pensive passenger, do not deny
To pause awhile and weep upon this tomb;
For here the cold remains of Cambell lie -
This narrow spot the vernal maidens doom.
With her, alas! The fairest talents fell -
And now her harp's melodious song is o'er;
Gone is that pulse, which pity lov'd to swell
And all her virtues are on earth no more.
Yes, she was gentle as the twilight breath,
That on the fainting violet's bosom blows,
Meekly she bow'd her to the frost of death
In faded semblance of the silver rose.
And oft low bending o'er this hallow'd ground
Shall the pure angel, innocence appear;
And friendship like a hermit, shall be found,
To bathe the cricling sod with many a tear.
On the death of a much loved Parent.
O Friend! if Agony could ne'er displace
Peace from her soul, or beauty from her face
If years of sufferance like some Saint she bore
And breath'd to virtue, till she breath'd no more.
whom we may expect soon to see. The Ship left London 9 months ago, and stopt at Cork 3 months.

In the Evening they returned to the number of 20 and again begun filling their baggs, upon the Constables endeavouring to drive them away, they turned on them, threw some spears but fortunately without hurting any of our men, they then closed in upon them, in consequence one was shott and one cut down with a sword, the head of one is brought in and the Lt.
