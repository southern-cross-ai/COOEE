I would not let them send it because they were encouraging you to come out and that was what I did not like because I had not a way that time to keep you from the strangers, but thanks be to God, it is not so now for I have selected 160 acres of land. I have one year's rent paid on it and has got my licence. I am not labouring it nor won't till November.  The rent is only 2s. an acre and in ten years I have it free, so thanks be to god it won't be so bad with you as it is a present if the Lord spares me, for, dear Margaret, I am going to send you £2 now and Ann Jane's husband, Mr. John Sherry is going to send you £1. If you be a wise good girl and stop single. The assistant emigration is stopped for a time; we expect it will commence again. Make up your mind and send me word if you will come out to this country and I will pay your passage  It is a great deal better out here for a girl than at home.
