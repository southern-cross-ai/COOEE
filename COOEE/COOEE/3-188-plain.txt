Any amount of intellectual power which the honourable and learned gentleman might have exhibited, would have been neutralised by a recognition, on all sides, of his utter want of any one moral principle which should govern the conduct of public men. 
In the eyes of the country, he symbolises a political profligacy; within the House he is a moral isolation, and he deserves to be. His proceedings are taken less as the results of anxiety for the public good, than as the activities of sheer personal spite. Men have made up their minds that the removal of Mr. Martin from office, tenderly as that was brought about after all, much more than any recent change in his former colleagues, had altered the honourable and learned member's point of view. His return to the present Parliament at all sprang far less from belief in him than from distrust of Mr. Cowper, and an opinion that the latter should be kept in check by any means whatever, even by Mr. Martin, faute de mieux. The history of responsible government presents nothing so disgraceful to the individual, nothing so painful to everybody concerned, as the explanation Mr. Martin volunteered the Assembly when, after the lapse of many days, he showed himself within the walls of the House as an ex-Attorney-General, there to give reasons why he was so. Mr. Martin seemed the only man in the Chamber insensible, as if by some disability and essential callousness of his moral nature, to the position of utter degradation in which he chose to put himself, by avowals altogether unchallenged and altogether uncalled for. A cast-off mistress on the flags before the door of her former entreteneur, shrieking out with aimless wrath her own shame, with the view of prejudicing the character of the once erring but now pale and penitent gentleman within, to passers-by and to a startled neighbourhood, would alone figure Mr. Martin pronouncing his own political infamy and the sacrifice of principle for the sake of "gratified personal ambition"; and all this amid the sardonic laughter and the contemptuous cheers of Mr. Donaldson and his followers, with Mr. Cowper the while, if he had a million faults, the injured one, sur la scène, looking very white and trying very hard to seem at ease. Universal suffrage is a cardinal point of our own political creed. Still we can perfectly comprehend and very fully respect the honest convictions of those who believe the making it law a final step for converting the country into a Gehenna. But what epithet can convey scorn sufficient, what expression deep enough of distrust in the man, who, looking upon it as shipwreck of the best interests of society, could remain the leading member of a Cabinet whose only claim and perpetual appeal ad misericordiam, through a career of marvellous incompetency, of extraordinary profligacy and extraordinary folly, was that it had, under pressure of popular demand, been the instrument of effecting a reform of electoral law, based practically on manhood suffrage? To be sure, in a smaller way, another legal member of Mr. Cowper's Government had distinguished himself by an equally serious and equally suspicious change in his opinions on this fundamental principle of politics. Mr. Solicitor-General Hargrave, on his first public appearance as a lecturer on law at the School of Arts, went out of his way, travelled positively beyond the legitimate limits of his thesis, to denounce universal suffrage as involving madness and wickedness, much of such a kind as sober English society sees in Pierre Leroux or Louis Blanc. On his latest public exhibition of himself, returned at Illawarra in exchange for the big Breakwater bribe, to the end that he might be made a law officer of the Crown, he opened a great trumpet-stop on the somewhat stiff and tuneless organ of his eloquence for a Laudate and a Gloria in Excelsis of Mr. Cowper on manhood suffrage. But poor Mr. Hargrave, like ce cher Lyttleton Holyoake, was an adventurer: worse still, not only a barrister without a brief, but a barrister without bread. Our constitution embodies a provision for the relief of gentlemen of the upper branch of "the profession" thus unhappily placed. Mr. Hargrave, in becoming a Minister in forma pauperis, like Mr. Lutwyche before him, was simply human. 
But Mr. Martin's case was very different. He really belonged to the country, was bound up with its interests, and had run a career of some promise, and certainly of very remarkable success. Had Mr. Cowper not resigned on Thursday, it would have been worth his while to have offered inducements to Mr. Martin to continue his hostilities. While, on the other hand, till the Opposition had succeeded in making their disclaimer of being identified with the honourable and, learned gentleman fully known and fully believed in, they would often have been without the sympathies of the right feeling and the right-minded in the community. But Mr. Martin displayed neither angelic address nor diabolical dexterity in moving his vote of censure of the 14th. In point of fact, in homely language, he made a mess of it. A better vantage-ground could not have offered for attacking Mr. Cowper's corruption than his recent judicial and legal appointments and the perversion of justice, gross and patent, to which the Government had lent itself. Mr. Martin, instead of selecting signal and almost unquestioned instances of this specific corruption of Mr. Cowper, chose to adopt the chronological and exhaustive method, with the view, no doubt, of showing that every legal appointment that had been made since the era of Mr. Martin's own resignation had been a bad one. 
His case might have rested on the circumstances connected with Mr. Owen's appointment as a judge, and the purchase from Mr. Chambers of his seat, by an office refused him before he had been returned to Parliament; the conduct of the Administration in the committal in Walsh v. Oxley, and one or two matters of a similar character, and for which the Government had not and could not have offered even the shadow of an excuse. He lost time and lost ground by talking of the wretched fatuity of making Mr. Lyttleton Holyoake Bayley Attorney-General, and amusing the House by the electioneering tom-fooleries, the naiséries and ninny hammerings of that remarkably absurd person. The Bayley business, besides, is generally understood to be the work of a power behind the throne - of a political entity equally without discretion and responsibility, and, like Cupid in the pleadings of the older poets, "too young to know what conscience is," - the honourable Member for Windsor, Mr. William Bede Dalley. The overweeningly parental fondness for this young gentleman of Mr. Cowper and Mr. Robertson made them yield, it is said, to him in the matter, and put into the hands of a stranger of two months' standing, and utterly unknown to themselves, as they have since confessed, the somewhat important function discharged in England by grand juries. This method of Mr. Martin's necessarily took in appointments fairly and properly enough, under the circumstances, made, as well as objectionable ones. For Mr. Hargrave as a politician, or any claim of his to be a minister of the Crown, we have, as we have already shown, ineffably small respect. But we do think no better choice could have been made for the bench of a District Court than the honourable and learned gentleman. Regarded simply as a lawyer, we believe him to belong to an order which Mr. Martin himself, with all his acuteness, tact, self-confidence, and best industry, will never attain. As to the remarks of the honourable and learned gentleman on Mr. Dalley's appointment as Solicitor-General, they were simply unjust and ungenerous, and no sufficient ground was presented for including him in the general indictment. 
Mr. Dalley's acceptance of the office was, as Mr. Martin's before him, on purely political grounds, and the last-named gentleman should have recollected that his own political position and standing in the House made him a Crown law adviser rather than any professional prestige that was attached to his name. That came afterwards, and the memories of the public are not so bad as not yet to have traces of the way in which Mr. Cowper went about puffing his first law officer's success at the bar as justifying his choice of an Attorney-General. 
And granting even that Mr. Dalley did commit some oversight in the conduct of some particular case, surely Mr. Martin is not so wrapped up in his own unchecked successes, and confined to so poor an experience of things professional, as to make that a ground for pronouncing wholesale unfitness for office. Did Mr. Martin never by any chance Commit a blunder in the management of a case himself? If he did not, he in one respect, from which lawyers, we have always understood, can claim no exemption as human beings, lies out of a category that includes alike Scarlett, and Follet, and Bethel. 
Mr. Dalley's sins as Solicitor-General are of a very different order to those which flow from inattention to official duties, or such marked incompetence to perform them as made his tenure of office objectionable. For certain things we believe Mr. Dalley to be deeply answerable - to men of very different stamp and with very different opinions to Mr. Martin's - men who have seen in Mr. Dalley's conduct betrayals of solemn pledges, and also moral incapabilities to perceive the sacredness and the real nature of purely political responsibilities, of a kind which but little trench upon the code of ethics Mr. Martin throughout proposed to himself as the rule of his public life. 
No; Mr. Martin was not the man to move a vote of censure on the Cowper Government, corrupt, enfeebled, and unprincipled as it was. And if the honourable and learned gentleman has really the good of the country in view by keeping Mr. Cowper out of power, he will best and most effectually serve it by abstaining from action altogether.
