There was at least one accident a week these last three or four. The other night a drunken man was knocked down and crushed; he almost died immediately. I have been pretty lucky not having hurt or killed anybody for so far. However I had one accident by a horse shying and running against the front of my dummy. 
The trains consists of a dummy and large sized tramcar very similar to the ones in Belfast only they are better got up. The dummy is the car which is in front and to which the car is coupled. It has seats all round very much like an Irish jaunting car. There is a seat across in front and behind exactly the same (either ends being front or rear according to which ways it is running - if it runs east the end which is the front was the back when running west). The side seats sit over the wheels exactly the same an Irish jaunting car. The grip space inside of which are the levers for starting and stopping the motion of the train, there is room enough for a dozen persons to stand but nothing but the engineer is allowed in it except the conductor when collecting fares
It is pleasant work along clear streets but where there is much traffic it is very troublesome
