Which - Society or Banks?
Right at the opening of parliament the two opposing forces, the one representing the people - the workers on the stations, in the shops and factories, and the farmers and storekeepers - and the other the soulless money-bags - that simply run banks, the stock exchange, commission agencies and deposit societies confront each other in battle array. The "reconstructors of society" join issue with the "reconstructors of smashed banks" and will fight to a finish to put an end to the present anarchy and oppose to the bitter end any attempt at its continuance by bolstering up an institution that has vampired the country dry. 
For years past the men of discernment, who understand the economic laws operating in civilised society have pointed out in season and out of season, at street corners, in parliament, in the workshops, and wherever anybody could be got to listen, the self-evident truth that: civilisation run on the principle of an idle or predatory class getting something for nothing - and as much of the valuable commodity as possible, would inevitably break down through its own inherent weakness. The clowns in public places of course made grimaces and cracked their stupid jokes: wrote leading articles in the daily papers, preached sermons, delivered electioneering speeches, sat in the Treasury Buildings and insulted deputations, and as far as was possible trumpeted their selfish ignorance to a wondering world. To them the "reconstructors of society" were ignoramuses or worse: didn't understand history and were entirely ignorant of economics, politics and "sound" finance. Were dreamers one day and rascals the next, and only wanted to be scoffed at to be put to utter rout.
The pancake browed type of man, such as is found in the Government, the Legislative Council and daily newspaper editorial chair, hasn't the faintest notion that we, the foremost nation of Western civilisation, are on the threshold of a new era. He can't imagine it. He - simple child that he is, in everything but years and commercial trickery - simply remembers that his father was dressed in a plug bat and frock coat and never talked of anything but a ledger and buying and selling and making profits and receiving divs.; till he supposed that the world must have started so. In fact, that Adam, as soon as he got out of the Garden of Eden, must have set up business as a bank director or company promoter. In short that human society with its ever-warring interests and blind production of wealth was always as it is to-day, and that it is impossible for us to evolve to a higher social state.
Such is the conception of Man and the State by the "Reconstructors of the banks," and little did they dream that a society run on the strength of banking institutions with high sounding titles - Royal this, and National that - paper money, embossed windows, cedar counters, and Government deposits would inevitably come to smash. How could it be otherwise? Banks are private commercial concerns, governed by laws precisely similar to those of the importers of pianos, hats, boots, or galvanised iron - with this important difference, that when they haven't got a stock of their commodity - money - (gold or silver) on hand, they can manufacture a fictitious article in the form of notes, and put it on the market as a genuine article of commerce. They are not allowed a mint to coin their own money, but may turn out paper by the ton. It is supposed, of course, for every £1 note there is issued there is a sovereign in the bank to meet it; in fact, the law is supposed to demand it, but as the law is invariably administered by bank directors the "law is an ass." So long as bank-notes represent gold of a standard value and the notes issued are not in excess of available coin and merely used as a convenient medium of exchange there is stability in the concerns - but the moment that principle is departed from (and generally it is) that instant with the help of overdrafts and boom valuations the banks enter on a career of insolvency.  And as in the case here in Queensland - where there is no State bank and politicians are bank directors and share-holders - they drag down thousands of innocent people with them in their headlong gallop to ruin.
Did the "reconstructors of society" propose the continuance of any such state of anarchy as now obtains, and as will recur again and again till Socialism outgrows the present system, no words could be used strong enough to condemn them. But they do not. They point out that the staple industries of this colony are controlled by the banks to everybody's detriment - even to the gamblers who fattened on the game. Every Queenslander needs work - not too much of it - and the reward of his labour should assure him a home and the requirements of modern social life. He should be mated if he wishes; should be able at all times to be well fed, comfortably clothed, and not denied any of the refinements possible to civilised people. Does our present mode of life enable all worthy citizens to secure this essential necessary to the realisation of our manhood? Will the reconstruction of the banks effect it? It is idle to suppose it will. Yet that right should be the inheritance born with every mother's son that comes into the world.
By the size of a giant's toe you can tell the strength of his wrist. In like manner by glancing at what is passing in our midst in Queensland to-day we can accurately take the measure of the whole capitalist world. On receipt of the news of the closing of the Q. N. Bank in Ipswich the municipal employes were immediately discharged; at Croydon mines were shut down as no wages were forthcoming, and exemptions claimed in consequence; factories and shops in Brisbane have been closed and workers discharged; even the hospitals are tied up, and the mass of the people crying out in despair. Bad as all this is, and attributable as most of it is to the maladministration of public affairs by men who should long since have been impeached and deposed, it is common to the system under which we live. It is a necessity of it, and were all the banks "reconstructed" to-morrow the evils would substantially remain.
Until we, the working people - and we all, every healthy adult man and woman, should be workers - establish the principle of cooperative production and equitable distribution of all wealth we shall be at the mercy of solvent and insolvent capitalists, bank smashes and Panama swindlers. To do this we must combine in unions and send Labour members to parliament. And don't let us forget that the break-up of the banks and return of Labour members to the legislatures of the world is to Commercialism what the down-fall of the barons and the rise of the trading class in the sixteenth century was to Feudalism.  It marks a new epoch - and we are going to realise it - if not in all its fulness, yet a good part of it - before the close of the century. A.G.Y.

Hints to Depositors.
Like a gigantic sponge the Q.N. Bank has for a long time past been sucking up the loans so generously provided by the people of Queensland. Lately, too, it has been absorbing unusually large sums from the Savings Bank. Timid depositors have been drawing their money from solvent banks to place it in the Savings Bank, whence of course it was taken daily to the Q.N. Yet in spite of these advantages, and in spite of the confident assertions of the Ministerialists that M'Ilwraith's return had made its position impregnable, it has now suspended payment.
Depositors, who are invited to vote for reconstruction, should bear in mind that every penny of the money due to the Government must be paid in full before they can get a dividend. At the reconstruction meeting the directors, having propounded their scheme, will of course expect depositors to tumble over each other in their eagerness to sanction it. They will also no doubt have much to say about their arduous and responsible work, and will expect depositors to pass a vote of confidence amidst enthusiastic cheering. But at this juncture caution is a much more reliable quality than confidence.
Depositors should be particularly wide awake in seeing that all losses are not thrown upon them. The £5 still due upon every share should be called up before the depositors are asked to lose a single penny. For years the shareholders have been receiving a 10 to 13 per cent, dividend. If then the shareholders have received all the profits why should they not bear all the losses? Monday's Courier, after speaking of possible objection from the English depositors to reconstruction, insinuates that the Government may use its enormous voting power to carry a scheme of reconstruction against their wishes. But when the Government is paid in full (as of course it must be) it would be a gross abuse of power on its part to vote at all. Such interference would be a mistake. It might perhaps even lead the depositors to believe that the object of the Government was to conceal certain big overdrafts.
Before blindly adopting the directors' scheme the depositors should hold a separate meeting, from which overdraft holders should be rigorously excluded. The depositors from among themselves should then appoint a committee to investigate the affairs of the bank, and bring up a report at a later meeting. This committee should be specially told to give answers to some such questions as these: Have any prominent politicians large overdrafts on insufficient security? 
Have the partners of prominent politicians large overdrafts?
Have companies in which prominent politicians are shareholders large overdrafts?
Have advances of £12 per share been made on Mount Morgans, now worth about £2 per share?
Did any directors withdraw their deposits or part of them during the last month?
Was the last dividend of £47,000 to shareholders paid out of profits?
Had any run on the bank started before that dividend was paid? Upon what mission was Glenny, the former manager of the bank, sent to London?
The committee, seeing that a most careful examination of the securities is an essential to a thorough understanding of the position of affairs, will also find it necessary to ask: What weight can be given to valuations made during the boom times?
The committee will likewise bear in mind that although the bank, say, holds a mortgage over 60,000 sheep, the stock may have aged or died since the money was advanced. The depositors may have boundless confidence in the directors, but confidence cannot bring dead sheep to life.
Even if after paying the Government in full the assets were not sufficient to pay 2s. in the £, who would expect the directors to volunteer such information at the first or succeeding meetings of depositors? A Queensland bank director, no matter how honest, is generally as sanguine as the insolvent who, after promising 15s. in the £, pays a dividend of 3.5d.
It is not suggested that the answers to the above questions will be against the directors, or that there is any ulterior motive for asking them, but only that the depositors will find it a good policy to seek for information. An impartial investigation is what is needed, not an investigation influenced by overdraft men. One such person in a Victorian bank (so it is rumoured in Melbourne) shouted and cheered for the "reconstruction" of the bank in which he was interested, so loudly that he won over the depositors who little dreamed that he owed the bank no less than £250,000.
The position of the Q.N. is very different from that of other banks. It must pay the enormous Government deposits before it gives the depositors a penny of their money. And it is hopeless now to expect even M'Ilwraith to float another loan - even for the benefit of a suspended bank. The daily papers, however, assert that he intends to call parliament together on the 25th instant for the purpose of guaranteeing Q.N. notes. Unless the object is to conceal certain big overdrafts it seems extraordinary that the Government should not itself issue the necessary notes, instead of guaranteeing the notes of a bank that has temporarily suspended payment.  Suppose that the Government guarantees the Q.N. notes for twelve months: During the twelve months the notes will be accepted readily enough; but if at the end of that time it happened that the Q.N. was not in a position to pay, there would be a rush to the Government for gold in exchange for the notes to demand payment under the circumstances supposed would be to compel the bank to suspend payment a second time. The only honest alternative, therefore, is for the Government itself to issue the notes. if the Government is really desirous of facilitating banking business and restoring confidence to the commercial community, it will receive sums for deposit at the Government Savings Bank, cash cheques drawn on such deposits, and generally transform it into a State bank with all its Security and reliability.
But will the Treasurer do this? or will he rather select as the Government bank of the future another private institution, with all its liability to a repetition of the present condition of things, thus compelling Queensland citizens to use a semi-public bank for the purposes of their business with none of the security accompanying it that a State department alone can give.
As M'Ilwraith's financial operations as public treasurer are always failures, the chances are that if he selects another bank it will be some local institution whose shares are below - very far below - par. It is, therefore, a very serious matter for Parliament to consider whether proposals he may submit to it can be entertained with advantage to the State. Speaking of banks, it is hard to say how much M'Ilwraith's incompetence has cost the colony. Certainly not less than £10,000 a year. Indeed, but for the Courier no one would ever have dreamt of giving M'Ilwraith credit for a knowledge of finance. For years it has continued to assert that he is a heaven-born financier till some people have really come to believe the statement. He was financier enough, however, to get most of the elections over before the bank "temporarily suspended payment." Z.
