Having cast anchor in the Harbour, which is called Sullivan's Cove, close to the town, Mulgrave battery with the residence of the Port officer at the water's edge appears to the left, and Mount Nelson in the distance.  Bordering also on the water is Cottage green, the residence of the Rev. R. Knopwood. the first chaplain of the colony; also the villas of Mr Read and Mr Moodie, and the Burying ground; also, on a fine commanding eminence, the Military barracks. Directly in front of the harbour is Government house, with pleasure grounds pleasantly sloping down to the water's edge. The public landing place is on a small pier or jetty, on what was formerly called Hunters island, but now connected with the main land by a long stone causeway. Here the principal merchants of the town have erected several spacious and substantial warehouses, among which may be mentioned the very extensive stores of the Leith Australian Company, as present let to Government as an Ordnance store. On the right is the Town rivulet, and beyond it, on a promontory called Macquarie point, the Engineer's stores, or Lumber yard, where the blacksmiths, carpenters. and other mechanics in the employment of the Government are always at work. On this point the troops arc reviewed on field days, and some of the inhabitants of the town occasionally recreate themselves at the game of cricket and other out-door amusements.  From Elizabeth-street the buildings extend nearly a mile on the main road to the interior.
NEWTOWN AND GLENORCHY - On leaving Hobart-town, Mount Wellington being 4 miles to the left, at the distance of 2 miles a small road turns off on the right hand to the lower part of New-town. ...At the seventh mile stone is the Green man, kept by Mr Bird, and at the eighth is Abbotsfield, a point of land stretching smile into the Derwent towards Mount Direction. A quarter of a mile farther is Roseneath ferry, on the road to Launceston, where Mr Austin keeps an inn with an excellent garden for the accommodation of visiters.
