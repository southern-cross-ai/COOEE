Dear Miss Lewin, I must begin by telling you about myself, but I will try and be as short as possible. I have gone on steadily here for three years and a half, and have managed to scrape together money to buy a piano and otherwise enable me to go live with my brother in Sale, Gipps Land, and enter into partnership with my sister who already has a pretty good school.
I do not leave Mrs Hines until Xmas. She is sending home for a Governess, or rather she is getting me to do so for her, as she knew no one whom she could depend on. Mrs Hines will not pay the passage for any one, and as I do not think there are many Governesses willing or able to embark the necessary sum, I have mentioned you as helping through your Society deserving persons in such a dilemma. You will perhaps wonder that when Mrs Hines had so much difficulty in the matter, she should send home - but she came to this decision from her observation of Governesses in this district who have come from Melbourne, and as a class they are not much to be admired.
Mrs Hines and Mr Hines and the children are very much to be liked, but no convent life could be more monotonous than life here is. The routine is teaching from 8 o'clock to dinner at 1 o'clock, again from 2 to 3 o'clock after which you are your own Mistress, but your resources are limited solely to intellectual amusements. Walking, owing to the heat and wet, is only possible a short time through the year & then you must be brave enough to go by yourself, for here they think it laborious. Driving is inconvenient, there being no roads only tracks, & as Mr Hines is now his own overseer he seldom has time to take us out riding as he used to do & a book, the piano, & fancy and plain work occupy you until bed time.  No one comes & there is no place to go to. I have never been unhappy here. and though I am sorry to part from Mrs Hines I am not sorry to leave the Bush. Believe me
Always yours gratefully
