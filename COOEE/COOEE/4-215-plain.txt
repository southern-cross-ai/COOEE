 is head milliner in a good house; has about £3 or £4 per week  She seems a fine woman and, as far as I can learn, has got a good principle. 
James's young lady is very quiet and reserved but very clever. She matriculated at the Ladies College in Melbourne intending to go for governess but her health began to fail with too much study so her father and mother thought better and brought her home so she has learned dressmaking and makes for her own family and teaches her younger sisters music.
