Dear Miss Lewin, I am so glad that my gratitude has caused you pleasure - but it did not half acknowledge what I feel or the benefit you have done me - I cannot tell you anything about the wants of Melbourne - except that I see in the Melbourne Newspapers accounts of a Society for 'Educated people in Indigent Circumstances', their applications to the Society published etc, & teachers of both sexes figure largely in the list.
In this district (colonial term) for three gentlemen there are six mushrooms, I suppose you would call them. The former I have heard say would like thoroughly good lady Governess from Home if they had any one there conscientiously to select them - the mushroom class pay largely but expect rather queer things - viz that the Governess should light the Schoolroom fire & similar things. They have been accustomed themselves to manual exertions & dont understand not keeping it up. In my short experience, I have known of two cases where ladies got with these people & very soon had to separate.
It is a totally different life from what it is at home. In nearly every instance you are looked on as the Intellectual Member of the Establishment. You are the constant companion & associate of the Lady - considered, I might say indulged, in every way - & your only difficulty is to civilize the children, which you are supposed to do through example as they are uncontrolled to a degree, & the parents object to anything else. I believe in Adelaide salaries are much lower than in Victoria.
I think with you that capable women have a better chance here than at home  - but I think a few of a good class not long accustomed to home scrubbing & drudgery would be a better importation than a larger number of the common run of Governesses - I think it a mistake unless very strong minded to come out here without having some relatives in the Colony - no out-door variety - no change of face or scene - so that the feeling of monotony & exile is apt to take forcible possession of you, unless you know you have a resource to shake it off. My thoughts on the subject may be very imperfect ones for I have never given it deliberate consideration. 
I remain dear Miss Lewin
Very truly yours
