We have one well down 414 feet and not a supply of water and still sinking. It is the intention of the present company to improve the stations and then sell. 
Zoocall has about 185,000 sheep on it. These stations will carry over half a million of sheep. we have a good season there will be that number on the stations. 
It is not likely that I will be home for some time as I have entered into partnership for 5 years to see this speculation carried through. We do not know how we shall come out of it. It is a large undertaking and requires a good deal of capital.
