Brisbane, Nov. 30th, 1896.
Sir, - I beg to acknowledge your letter of the 23rd inst., enclosing me an Address, for which I beg to thank the President and members of the Convention.
I am glad to know the deliberations of the meeting were carried on with such thorough purpose.
I shall be glad to see the breaking down of those artificial barriers which are so prejudicial to the growth and development of the Australian colonies.
I remain, dear Sir, yours truly,
LAMINGTON.
The Rev. Arthur J. Webb, Secretary People's Federal Convention.
