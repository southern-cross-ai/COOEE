I received your and dear Mary Ker's letters of September 1831, in October 1832. You do us an injustice to censure us for a moment for not writing and thinking of you. Never a day passes that we do not speak of you and, as I have all along told you so few vessels call at this port, except to barely supply us with provisions, that we have not frequent opportunities of sending. Besides, I always hesitate to send a single letter, knowing the expense thereof.
We have all been quite well since writing. In November Molloy went to the Swan on business. He remained a month, and was brought back in H.M.S. Imogene. Capn Blackwood, perhaps a friend of Roberts', as he is a nephew of Sir H. Blackwood, from whose name this river is called. He is a very nice gentlemanly man and connected with the Grahams of Netherby.
Molloy went away again last Monday to view his large "grant" on the Vasse - a most pleasing country and answering with truth to the description given of its park-like appearance, with long waving grass, and abounding also in kangaroos.
In the interim a vessel has come in, which has given me not only my own, but Jack's letters to write, which I am almost unable to do, as at the beginning of the week I was confined to bed from over-exertion. For in truth, Maggie, I have not time to say my prayers as I ought. I must unbosom myself to you, my dear girl, which I have never done - but this life is too much both for dear Molloy and myself; & what I lament is that in his decline of life he will have to lead a much more laborious life than he did in one and twenty years' service. He does not despair but I never knew anyone having his losses to bear but who would.
May God have mercy on us and poor little Sabina Dunlop who is remarkably well and as I lay in bed on Monday she all at once got up and began to walk. She came to my bedside and said "Mam, Mam". She keeps going backwards and forwards the whole day long with something for me & never cries though I dip her in a tub of water. She has 10 teeth, two of which are double. She began to toddle in Molloy's absence. On Monday she was 14 months old. She is a great blessing. I need not blush to tell you I am, of necessity, my own nursery-maid. If I could afford to keep one, they are so exceptional I durst not trust my child with them...
By this I write to Mary and Mrs Caldicott. I have had seven letters of Molloy's relating to business to answer, besides my own correspondent; to weigh out rations, attend to Baby, & although needlework of every kind both for her, Molloy, myself and servant is required, I have not touched a needle for this week.  I am now exhausted, and the day uncommonly hot.
I told you how it would be! I should have to take in washing and Jack carry home the clean clothes in a swill. The last of this has not happened yet; but between ourselves, dear Maggie, the 'washing' is no uncommon occurrence! But time will show! What goes to my heart is that dear Molloy has so much exertion bodily & mental. But I am repaid with interest when any part I can perform eases his burden. The Lord is good and has shown Himself to us in many wonderful instances, but we are sadly forgetful of His Love and bounty amid the hurried concerns of this life.
Oh! my loved "sister"! I cannot contain myself when I think of the past. I never, never trust myself to think of all we have said to one another...
What is all this about Irving and the supernatural gifts? Please tell me. My head aches & I have all the clothes to put away from the wash; Baby to put to Bed, make tea & drink it without milk as they shot our cow for a "trespass"; read prayers and go to bed besides sending off this tableful of letters. I wish I had you here to help me! What golden dreams we used to have about your coming to stay with me! How would you like to be nearly three years without a woman of your own rank to speak to, or to be with you whatever happened?
Sabina has just toddled in, hiding her little face with her hand in play. She is sometimes so lively she is "neither to hand nor to find", as James Angus would express it. Pray remember me to them all. I wish Andrew would write & find us out. I shall write to him. My kind love to Robert and accept the same with unabated affection from your sincerely attached sister.
