(Enter DICK DUGGAN and POUNCE.)

STEVE: All right.
(Exit.) 
DUGGAN: Now then, mate, there's no one else within cooeeing distance. What ye got to say?
POUNCE: Hush! Not so loud. We must be careful, sir, careful, altho' it's a mere matter of business, sir - nothing more.
DUGGAN: All right - spit it out. And look here - take off them goggles when you're jawing to me. I want to see that you're dealing on the square. There's no one to spot you here - -take 'em off.
(POUNCE does so.)
Now what do you want with us ?
POUNCE: Hush! You know Matt Morley, don't you?
DUGGAN: I do.
POUNCE: Ah yes, yes, and I'm told that you've no particular reason to love him.
DUGGAN: Love him!
POUNCE: Hush, my dear sir. For Heaven's sake be quiet.
DUGGAN: Well, get on. If you know who I am, and that bad blood's between Matt Morley and me, come straight to what you want at once.
POUNCE: Yes, certainly, yes. You don't love him, and if you could you'd pay him the grudge you owe him.
DUGGAN: I would.
POUNCE: Good, very good. Now I know another party who has a grudge against this Morley and who wouldn't mind paying liberally to gratify that grudge.
DUGGAN: What do you want done and what'll you pay?
POUNCE: Well, you see, my principal objects to Mr. Morley's presence in England, and he's willing to pay certain sums to any person who will prevent said Mr. Morley leaving the Colonies.
DUGGAN: There's one sure way to prevent him. (Drawing pistol) Is it this you mean?
Pounce: Put it up, it's dangerous - besides, I said nothing of violence.
DUGGAN: No, you didn't, but I don't suppose you'd cry your eyes out if he'd an ounce of lead in him. What d'yer pay for it?
POUNCE: Nothing at all, sir. Good gracious, I suggested a simple thing - - that as long as Mr. Morley stayed in the Colonies my principal is prepared to pay certain sums --- - -mere matter of business, nothing more. 
DUGGAN: What makes you think he's going to leave?
POUNCE: That's my business, sir. Why shouldn't he? His claim's turned out well and today I hear they've found a gigantic nugget.
DUGGAN: Eh! They have! Where is it! What's its value?
POUNCE: They took it to the bank, and I'm told it's worth six or seven thousand pounds.
DUGGAN: Well, suppose I says as 'ow Matt Morley shan't leave the Colonies for England, what's yer pay if I stop him?
