Just now young fellows are willing to take anything over and above what will pay their board, anything from 25s. to 35s. a week and very few get the chance of the latter wages. 
Trade has been slow in Echuca for a considerable time and the outlay was greater than the income so the largest salaries must go. However I have had a good innings in Echuca and as I put a bit of money into Tambo Crossing while I had a good salary it will come in very useful now. 
I am not going to lose any time looking for a billet as they are too scarce and the wages now offered I would not accept (having the land to fall back on) 
I will therefore be off to Tambo Crossing next week and help J. Colven with his fencing and then get his help to get a better crop into the garden. Fannie, the little one and myself have stayed over a fortnight at Bendigo. Fannie will stay here for a while at her mother's till I get things a bit fixed up at the Crossing. Besides she will be just as well here for a little while till she gets stronger and the baby is a bit older.
