The Cheshire rounds and Irish trot were also gone through with equal success, after which a contest for the BREECHES ensued, but was determined in favour of Madam Beatrice, and the ladies at parting, withdrew in triumph.
On Monday evening a grand serenade of CULINARY instruments waited on the new-married pair, which in harmony came little short of marrow-bones and cleavers. The musicians demanded a fee, imposed by custom, and which being complied with, the YOUNG couple were left to their domestic QUIET.
MARRIED.
Yesterday se'nnight, by the Rev. Mr Dixon, of the Church of Rome, Henry Simpson, shipwright, to Catharine Rourke, of the Rocks, Widow.
