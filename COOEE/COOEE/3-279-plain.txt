As to the general principles, I need not say much. They are comprised under the three general heads which were announced on the hustings by the Chief Secretary and other members of the Cabinet. They have now, as far as I can judge, been very generally accepted by the people of the country. There may be differences of opinion as to the mode in, and extent to, which those principles should be carried out; but it appears to me, as far as I can judge, that a large majority of the country, and of the representatives of the people in this house, including some members of the late Government, are in favour of those three cardinal points, namely, secular, compulsory and free education. There is nothing new in these proposals, because, since the Cabinet was formed, we have been pledged to the country to bring in a measure based upon these three principles. Perhaps there is a more universal feeling in favour of secular education than of either-of the other two points. The feeling is almost as general in favour of compulsory education. But, as far as I can judge from conversations which I have had with educated men, some of them intimate friends of my own, who take the same view as the Government with regard to secular and compulsory education, there is some doubt felt as to the third element-free education - about which undoubtedly there is more novelty than in either of the other two proposals. I have thought over the subject for a long time with great interest, and the more I learn, and the more I consider this matter and the relation of the position of this colony towards it, the more enamoured I am of the principle of free education; and I regret that it cannot be carried out to the fullest extent. However, I will not anticipate the details on this point. First, then, as to secular education, I think it is a necessity in this country, and it is a settled question; I do not think it requires any argument, nor do I think it requires illustration by the practice of other countries. It will probably be said that in many of the old countries from which we must draw our example secular education does not prevail. In the great example of Prussia, for instance, religious instruction forms part of the State system of education; and so with regard to other countries in Europe. This can be done in those countries for the simple reason that religion is part of the State; and, as the State there can control religion, it can control the schools, even though religion is taught in them. It does not at all follow that because I and others advocate secular education, therefore we undervalue religion. I have said this before, and it is right to say so again whenever called upon to express our opinions on the subject. The principle of the existing Act, properly carried out, is secular education. I believe myself that, as far as sectarian teaching has been introduced into the schools, it has been done in violation, or at all events evasion of the Act.  It is not necessary for the teaching of religion that it should be taught in the schools. Religion can be better taught by other persons than by the schoolmasters; and every truly religious person feels it to be his or her duty to assist, or promote in Some way, the teaching of religion. It will be taught where the community is truly religious, and it will not be taught by any machinery of the State in a community which is not truly religious. I fully concur with the principle that the State has nothing to do with the teaching of religion. But whether that is a right principle or not, it has been adopted by the State - it is part of our law. So far am I from thinking it desirable that the State should undertake the teaching of religion, if it could do so, and if we all belonged to one particular form of religious belief, that I say, speaking with a deeply religious feeling, it is undesirable that religion should be taught by the schoolmaster. One necessary consequence of such a system is that religion is made unpleasant to the pupils. No child has ever a pleasing recollection of any so-called religion taught to him at school. A still greater evil of the system is that it satisfies the consciences of those whose duty it is to teach religion. In many churches in England it used to be the practice when I was at home, and it may still be so in some churches there, to have a parish clerk to make the responses for the congregation, and the congregation left it to the clerk to take their part in the service. So if people can only shelter themselves and their consciences under the excuse that a schoolmaster is paid to teach their children religion, they will not trouble themselves about teaching it at all. And not only will the people at large not do so, but clergymen, whose primary public duty it is to teach religion, will neglect to do so. If it were a question of whether, in the establishment of a new colony, we should or should not have a State religion, and whether the State should become responsible for the teaching of religion, I should say "No". I don't say I should have said so when first I came to Victoria, but enlightened, as I trust I now am, and having come in contact with a number of persons holding religious faiths almost identical in character, and differing mainly in outward forms, I should vote against the State teaching religion. The next point is that of compulsory education. I do not altogether like the word, but I regard compulsory provisions as a necessity in order to secure the sending of children of certain classes to school. The law, as we are told upon high authority, is only "a terror to evil-doer's". 
If there were no evil-doers, it would not be necessary to have any laws. I may state broadly that compulsory education, as a rule, only answers where the people themselves accept it as the right thing. If compulsory education is the law of a country, it will stand in the same position as other laws. If the people do not accept it as a law they believe in, it will probably fail. In Scotland and in America, where the people themselves are thoroughly imbued with the desire to have their children educated, such a law is not wanted.  I quite admit that as a general principle.  In this country the question is - Why must education be compulsory? In making education compulsory, while I trust that the measure may continue law, I also hope that, before many years are over, it will be, in point of fact, a law entirely, or substantially, in abeyance. I regard it as a means necessary to introduce at the present time in order to teach parents, by a moderate pressure - by a moderate dose of compulsion - to do that which, when they have done it, they will find to their own advantage. It is sometimes said that a large proportion of the children of this colony do attend school, and that, therefore, a compulsory law is not needed here. It is said that nearly as large a proportion of the children attend school in this colony as in England and in various favorable countries on the continent. I am not sure that it is not so. I believe that our statistics are tolerably reliable, and they show that about one in eleven of the whole population attends school, which is a very fair proportion. I believe that we have a very efficient staff of school inspectors, an able body of teachers, and good -machinery. Every credit is due to men who, under many disadvantages, have worked well in order to induce the people of this country to send their children to school. The result has not been unsuccessful, but I think that, in a country like this, we ought not to be content as long as any children do not attend school. We have two classes of children absent from school who ought especially to be considered. The first class consists of those waifs and strays found in all large cities. I do not know whether that class is worse here than in other countries. Probably it is not; but the class is one whose condition everyone must be desirous of improving. The second evil with which we have to cope is one peculiarly our own. We have been for years following a policy of spreading the people over the lands; and no one will deny that some of our best immigrants, forming one of the most valuable portions of our population, are placed out upon the lands in remote districts. We have sent them out into all corners of the country, and it is our plain duty to follow them with schools. Many of these persons were in a superior condition of life at home - farmers who came out here, it may be, with capital, capital, and who would never have dreamt of leaving their children uneducated at home, but who, unfortunately, have acquired the habit of neglecting the education of their children in this new country of their adoption, and of forgetting almost everything but the growing of crops and the material prospects of their families. It will require something more than the simple inducement offered by free education to cause these people to send their children to school, and that something more is a compulsory provision. It will be seen from the Bill that compulsory education is introduced in a very mild - and gradual form. It is a new experiment in this country. I believe that it is altogether a new experiment as regards the English race. In England, however, an Act has been passed which is to have a sort of permissive operation, with the view of trying the compulsory principle there.  
There are certain clauses in the last English Education Act which permit the local bodies to introduce, within certain defined limits, the principle of compulsory education. The Act restricts them as to the ages of children, the hours of attendance, and the fines to be imposed upon persons who disobey the regulations to be framed under the measure. Now we are going to try the experiment of compulsion upon the whole of the colony, and I trust that we shall in this, as we have done in some other cases, set an example to our progenitors in England. I hope that it will be found a successful experiment in two particulars. In the first place, I trust it will be admitted that it is not a tyrannical interference with private rights any more than a police law is; that the people generally will recognise that it is a crime to neglect the education of their children, just as much as it is a crime to neglect to feed and clothe them. In the second place, I hope that as soon as the law is passed it will be obeyed, so that - just as when persons get into the habit of being sober, they no longer require the law to restrain them from intoxication - when persons get into the habit of obeying this law, the compulsory principle, though it will continue on the statute-book, will be a dead letter, troubling no one. I now come to the question of free education. That is a point upon which I feel strongly. Everybody admits that those who cannot afford to pay school fees ought to have their children educated without paying any fees. Education being made compulsory, a fortiori, it would be slicer tyranny to fine a man who cannot send his children to school because he has not money to pay the school fees. The question then arises what is to be done? It may be said - "Remit the fees as at present". What does that mean? It degrades the children of poor people, in the eyes of their neighbours, into paupers; it turns them into recipients of alms. Does not experience show that children under those circumstances will not be in a fair position to learn side by side with the children of more favourably situated classes? Once admit that all children, whether rich or poor, ought to be educated; and it seems to me to follow, as a matter of course, that the State must pay for the education of these children. That is not almsgiving, but the principle of co - operation carried out to its fullest extent. It is altogether a mistake to suppose that, when we avail ourselves of any ordinary convenience of a civilized community, paid for out of the taxes to which we all contribute, directly or indirectly, we take it as a gift. The child of the poorest parents who is sent, without paying any fees, to be educated by a master supported by the State, does not receive his education in the way in which a child receives education at a charity school in England, but he gets it as one of the advantages derived from living in a free country where all co-operate in supplying the common necessities.
