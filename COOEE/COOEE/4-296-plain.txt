It is reckoned the hardest work a man can go at out here. I got 1s. 0d. per hour 8 hours a day. I did well and was saving fast when the weather broke and the Australian winter came on rendering work by the hour or day no good as one could only make tucker (3 bob a day). 
You can see by this that I am a better man by twice than when I left home and a passable axeman as you have to be to get on a felling gang. But had the weather not broke up I would have had to gone home as I caught a severe cold and a terrible attack of dysentery of which I am afraid it will cost me something to get rid of. All the evacuations are mucus and blood in large quantities and at very short intervals. 
It is just possible I will go to the gold fields this winter if this disease don't put me under. In the bush one can't get medicine and only the most local and cheap remedies are all I can obtain such as warmth, rest, castor oil, laudanum and chlorodyne. I have been a week now and no improvement. I wish I was well as I think I see my chance of making £40 or £50 in a few months. My knee is not painful nor am I lame as expected but it feels stiff in wet weather or when I squat down etc. 
I cannot make up my mind here for more than a month at a time. I mean that Geoff and I talk now of going fencing, then off gold seeking, then off Kimberley and God knows what next. He was grubbing trees on the line and Elyjah and I felling. Where the rails and embankments and cuttings go the trees must be grubbed up by the roots but 22 yards each side can be chopped and felled as they more commonly call it.
