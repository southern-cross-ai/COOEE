 we purpose staying at Fisher's convenient to where the bees are or taking the house connected with the gardens the bees are in. The only inconvenience in connection with the latter is we would have to keep a housekeeper and that I would not like to risk in the hands of a stranger. If we had some trustworthy friend it would suit well. 
Agnew then had a short conversation with the Company partner (Mr Cullen). I was brought forward and introduced to him. Of course I soon saw that I had been talked about before as Mr. Purce another co-partner (brother-in-law to Mr Agnew and a country man of ours) had sounded me the first day I was in. They then made me an offer viz. £2 per week to begin the following morning and I would have charge of a department after the holidays when stock would be taken, so you see I have been assisting the man in charge up to Friday 24th being the day before Christmas and when I was getting paid (being only a week past on Thursday previous they paid me for a week and a half viz. £3 wasn't bad for a start was it?) Mr. Agnew fully initiated me as charge of the hardware side of that flat to commence after the holiday viz. 28th December. He told me the better I made it pay the better it was for myself and for them. 
The holidays commenced on Saturday (Christmas day) and continues until tomorrow Tuesday. We will have another holiday on Saturday being the New Year. I spent Christmas quieter than usual, went over to Kew and had dinner with John as I was invited by his landlady but unfortunately John had to go on duty at 2pm until 8pm. He is now on the grip (or engineer) as extra man. He had 8 runs yesterday (Sunday) and 11 for today which means about 1s. per run. He is in great spirit since he got on the dummy was dull enough at the time-keeping; the hours were too long and there was not enough of go in it for Jack. You must excuse him for not writing as he has been kept rather close to duty since I landed  told me you always got most letters when he was not in the best of health or when he was off for spells so from this you may conclude he is in good health when he is not writing. I did not see him yesterday but went on foot to Fitzroy this afternoon (a distance of about 2 miles) and met him on his engine a little way from the terminus and had a ride to the other end of the line with him. He could only talk to me occasionally as it is forbidden that the engineers should talk to passengers in case their attention is drawn off their duty. John says quite coolly they have to watch and not kill any of them (meaning the people. You would think it was bees he was talking about). He (John) intends taking a run round this week to try and get suitable lodgings for us both convenient to the bees. They have been neglected lately  you will be glad to know that all the Bangorians except George Smith and he may be into a good job but we have not heard of him.  R. Hanna is in a store in Paran (I think is the name) convenient to Melbourne. John Hanna is in the same house as myself. D. McClintock is in one of the stations I think Spencer Street station. S. Cullough went away last week to a crib near Sydney; so far we have been fortunate.
