July 14, 1838 
Dear Sir, 
We arrived here through much mercy, on the 1st of the month in health and safety and after an unusually long passage being 20 weeks from England. Mr Hadfield wrote to you from the Cape, where we put in for fresh water &c. I also wrote to Mr Broughton desiring him to send me a new Black Dress of clothes (thinking that by the time they arrived I should want them). Also Davenant's Commentary on the Calossians; and Milner's Church History to which I would now add Owen's Commentary on the Hebrews. These Books I could wish to have, as I know somewhat the value of them. But I wish them to be paid out of my yearly salary as I have a little money with me to discharge any incidental expenses which I might incur here. 
Since our landing, I have been busily employed in making preparations to proceed to my destination, to which place, (if God will) I shall proceed on Monday next. I go by the Mail to Bathurst, where I expect to have a horse sent me by Mr Watson, from Wellington, as Rev. Mr Cowper has written to Mr Watson to that effect. 
If Mr Broughton has not sent the above-mentioned articles, perhaps you would be kind enough to allow them to be sent the first opportunity, as the only way of my obtaining anything from England is through the medium of the Society. 
Mr Hadfield and myself are both well in health, for which we would thank our Heavenly Father, who is ever with us, to guide, guard, and help us with the riches of His Grace, and to keep us by His Glorious power, through Faith, unto Salvation. We are living together very agreeably, speaking to and edifying each other continually in those things which belong to our everlasting peace. 
I remain dear sir, 
Your humble servant in the Lord 
William Porter.
