But you can't make a joke of everything. For instance, you can't laugh at a man's finding his way to office through the doors of the Insolvency Court, a gentleman who has gone in to be whitewashed, but because the dirt was unusually thick the cleansers of commercial immorality, in a place proverbially not fastidious as to its subjects, declined to apply the brush. 
We can conceive then how the old Empire, as severe and stoical in its morals as the late Empire, - a young lady notoriously of questionable character, as loose and complying in hers, - would have arraigned the conduct of a special uncertificated insolvent, who with an effrontery no other man in the country, in his unfortunate position, could have exhibited, not only managed to slip into Parliament, but did all he could to annoy and obstruct honest and deserving men, because, forsooth, they hadn't made him a Minister of State, and to the end that he might make himself one. We know how that stern and rigid purist, the older Empire, used to bare all blushing to daylight the imputed delinquencies of Mr. Parkes' present friend and patron, Mr. Darvall, at seasons when it was most ungenerous to do it. And then Mr. John Bayley Darvall's imputed peccancies were peccancies that touched nobody's pockets but Mr. John Bayley Darvall's own. It is very unpleasant to have to say this kind of thing. But in politics you're forced to say unpalatable things. For, a reader who has continued that poetic and purely imaginative view of politics which mankind calls Patriotism, the most essential feature in politics is that it oftenest consists of the audacious attempts of an impudent and unscrupulous fellow, with assurance as the largest portion of his stock-in-trade, to get rule of his fellow-citizens, and his salary to boot, by any means whatever. Lay to your soul, O unsophisticated and tender-hearted reader, who thinks us unkind, the moral of our contemporary The Sydney Morning Herald's first leader on the fall of the Forster Ministry. It was admitted that the Administration was an honest one, but that it wanted "cleverness." Cleverness! William Forster, poet, journalist, acknowledged political thinker, eminent debater in the House, not clever? Geoffrey Eager, sparkling speaker, thorough man of business, keen philosophic writer on political topics; John Black, most ornate of local orators, and framer of a land policy for the commonwealth; Saul Samuel, always a Saul amongst profits, and not only a financier but a Jew financier, - these men not "clever"! Pre-posterous, you say; the Herald never does tell the truth. Ah, but, reader, look here. The Herald knows political technology better than you do. "Clever" refers to that particular idea of dangerous excellence which presents itself to your embittered moral mind in connection with a fellow who, having swindled you barefacedly, actually "bilked" you out of a hundred or two, has made everything so neat and clean, so right and taut, that you are bullied up in King Street as a vindictive Shylock, and your archetype of all human rascality is granted his certificate tenderly and with many condolences by that most credulous of men, considering the society he keeps, ex officio, Mr. Purefoy. And just again, reader, having got a correct idea of the meaning of the phrase, don't you regard Mr. James Martin, as a public man, of course, a very "clever" fellow? 
We think it was right, or, at all events, acceptable, to say this before we showed you the picture. Now, Brunhilda, pull away the curtain, and let us look at the first cartoon. 
There it is! It's a roaring place that, isn't it? You see the feeding-place of the lions of the fold of Judah, of the representatives of the people. It's the only place in the county where they really know how to make Badminton and dish up a turkey. You're thinking of Cheval's? Well, yes, Cheval's is a nice place for French kickshaws and a palatable pint of vin ordinaire. But for the solid supports of the British Constitution in Her Majesty's Colonies, you must steal a look at the refreshment-room in Parliament Chamber, Macquarie Street, just as the House has emptied for vesper-stomachics. Never mind that solitary, ruminative figure with the glass of pensive sherry and the cold fowl before it, and two big volumes, like law books, under its sturdy elbow. That's little Pid, as honest as gold, let them say what they like about him, whom Mr. Cowper, holding Jack Robertson, as he always used to do, as a fly at the end of his fishing rod (he hooked Chambers of Maitland in that way), once angled for. But look at the corner of the wine room, where the "Peers," as they call the Second Chamber within the precincts, take their hot whiskey during late sittings. The three figures - what a group! The colour is a little sombre, but what drawing! Henry Parkes has a pen in his hand, and he draws better than the Crown Law Officers when there is anything to be gained. But he knew that before he went into Darvall's Chambers. He owes that distinguished man nothing for the lore. Ask Wilshire. 
Somehow, you know, the Eastern origin of the Jew comes out in his love of personal ornament. Up in George Street, he doesn't put an aigrette of diamonds on his Sabbath turban, because British Jews don't wear turbans, they leave them to their dowager ladies. But look at the big chain on the velvet waistcoat, and the showy ring on the little finger, not to speak of the glittering stones on the shirt studs. The other figure - well, he is a beauty to be in the Parliament of an English community. He doesn't talk English. No, certainly. I don't mean to say he's a foreigner. He is, perhaps, North of England, or North of Ireland more likely. You who are not yet cured of your poetic illusion about politics, want to know why men without intellect, education, standing, or important services, in spheres other than political ones, are sent into the Great Council of the country, to make laws for and to guard the interests of the commonwealth. Well, do you happen to have the honour of knowing Mr. Terry, the honourable Member for Mudgee, or Mr. Lucas, who represents unepiscopal Canterbury out in the bush? Fit only to break stones or drive bullocks, you say; well, you are blunt, but you may be right. But, constitutionally, the majority has more right than either you or I have, and the majority (God bless it!) thought them, the democratic majority, fit men, mind you, to cope with Martin and Hay and Darvall and other very lofty-notioned people, to protect and do battle for popular rights. 
You are amused; but really you must pardon me if I do not see the element of humour in what I say. I set out by saying Punch, as universal commentator, is a mistake; there are some things which have no possible joke about them. The honourable gentleman who took up the Prime Minister's glove, and moved the direct want of confidence forthwith, is Mr. Gray. Ask him if the functions of the judiciary are by any constitutions necessarily separate from those of the executive, or whether select committees of the House might not abridge the means of the Supreme Court business by hearing motions for new trials, instead of leaving them to the Court in banco: he'll settle it. What is he doing? Sitting there, listening to the strains of certain dulcet charms. Jack Robertson is patting him on the back; - Jack always does pat people he is managing on the back. And that political Stoic, that man of Roman virtue, quite plain enough, as the ladies would say, to be distressingly good, is perusing the words of a resolution for the Catspaw, the aforesaid Mr. Gray, who could not write his grammatical sentences in a petition against a king, - now gone out of fashion, the chopping off the head for treason, - if he were compelled to make prayer in that behalf. Candid, sincere, patriotic, and, at the same time, thoughtful, gifted Mr. Parkes makes the balls; poor, stolid, stupid Mr. Gray fires them. Mr. Parkes just now supports, but doesn't move votes of want of confidence in Ministries. 
By the way, how poor Forster used to be praised in the old Empire. Forster, in those days, by some miracle, had no share in original sin. And how well Forster could write leading articles in those times, - the period when Sir Henry Watson Parkes cried like a child at the way he was worried. But look at Henry Parkes, the figure, I mean, which is painted writing at the table the resolutions which some time later in the evening Mr. Gray, "big with the fate of Caesar and of Rome," is to move. He's a grotesque figure in that picture, certainly; all arms and legs, like some mischievous creature you meet in the grass. But that's nothing; from Ã†sop downwards, providence has pleased to lodge splendid intellects in very queer trunks. The ladies - bless them! with their instincts, infinitely surer than our masculine minds - know this. 
John Wilkes, you recollect, said - with his squint even -  the handsomest man in a room had only half-an-hour's advantage of him. But he's what they call a psychological curiosity, Henry Parkes, I shan't go into that. Who would have thought that he who commenced life selling little innocent blue and white toys for your small Marys and jemmies to break, would approach its zenith by himself breaking Ministries of the people in the Sovereign Parliament of the land? There was a powerful man here in New South Wales once, who ruled the councils of the country, William Charles Wentworth. He did once on a time go to buy toys of Mr. Parkes. Perhaps he did it on commercial principles - going to the cheapest market, gratifying his household angels at a low figure; perhaps he did it to insult one of the demagogues and supporters at public meetings of the day; for Mr. Wentworth could do paltry things for a great man. He thought he was an able and gallant man, bearding Mr. Deas Thompson and the imperially nominated officials of his day. Did he dream that the toyman would do greater things, in planning and executing the destruction of responsible Ministers in after times? Somebody once told us that Mr. Parkes, of all the toys in his shop, loved most the Chinese puzzle in ivory. As no one ever appreciated him as a man for a Ministry, perhaps, to beguile time, he takes to old fancies, and indulges in a love for political puzzles. But his puzzles are not as white or clean, though they are almost as polished as the old toys in "laborious orient ivory." 
You see Mr. Gray has made up his mind to take in the resolution. Poor man! he looks as firm as when once he frightened a bull which Mr. justice Owen allowed into his dairy paddock at Wollongong. But we, who love democracy and the people, are sick of the crimes committed in a sacred name, and the people who make democracy a trade. That's the first cartoon. We'll show you the rest. Brunhilda, draw the curtain over the picture, and ask Heraclea to bring in some cigars. Ah! Berenia, come at last, queen of Colonial lady politicians, what a delicious shade of colour in the feather and ribbons of that Argyle hat, the autumnal turn of the beech in Europe! Pray, what is Sir Daniel Cooper's next trick? He's been working - oh, I know! You went down harbour in a skiff, like the Lady of Shalott, and met him trying to paddle his lonely dingy up in answer to the Governor-General, on the moonlit waves of Broken Bay. Reader, you have seen the picture, you must not hear the lady, and you don't smoke.
