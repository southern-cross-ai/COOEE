We were sorry to know that he had been so unwise as to make a country's talk of himself by the mean way he got it done, especially as it will grieve both father and mother. If I were you all I would not make too rash a decision about send him out here as father is not so able to look after things as he used to do. Of course I should not like all the time I wrought hard and sore to go back to any of Henry McClintock's grand-daughters. I have had letters from both James and Hugh stating that if the girl is decent and bears a good character, that David is of age and ought to make his own choice. I believe the better way would have been to have let him have the farm at a valuation and let him marry Miss Jennings sometime ago. However that opportunity is lost now so we will have to make the best of a bad job. If he comes out here either by himself or with his wife we all shall join in giving him all the help and advice that lies in our power as he is our own brother. I think it would have been wiser to have let James Colven come along with him if he comes as it will be very lonely and awkward for him to come by himself, he being not over quick and not having travelled much. If he comes, we, Sarah and I, will help and I am sure the boys will do the same, to pay for a good man to assist father in the farm work.
