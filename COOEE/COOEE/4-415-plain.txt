FIFTH DAY'S DEBATE.
Debate resumed on resolutions proposed by Sir Henry Parkes (vide page 23).
Mr. DIBBS: 
Sir, I have listened with patience and interest to the speeches which have been delivered by the distinguished men who have preceded me, and I must confess to a feeling of nervousness in attempting to follow the speeches that have been delivered and in attempting to add anything to the arguments that have been used. And yet I venture to think that in the main the important speeches that have been delivered have to a certain extent but touched the fringe of the question of federation. If I were asked my opinion as to who was the speaker who dealt most boldly  and vigorously with that which is to be the centre and basis on which a federation of the colonies can take place, I should say that it was my hon. friend, Sir Thomas McIlwraith. We have had from very able speakers, namely, the hon. members, Sir Samuel Griffith, Mr. Deakin, and Mr. Barton, a clever discussion as to one phase of the federation question; that is, with regard to state rights. No doubt that is one of those questions which will have to be dealt with by the Convention in due time; but it appears to me that we are just a little in advance in dealing with the question of state rights before we agree among ourselves as to what is to be the real basis upon which federation shall take place. As, however, the debate proceeding upon the resolutions which you, sir, have moved, has taken the shape of a discussion of the question of state rights, it would, perhaps, be more convenient to the Convention if I now said a few words on that subject. So far as I have heard, and I have paid the utmost attention to the arguments used, the contention is conclusively in favour of making the senate a strong and powerful body in the interests of the whole of Australasia, and in the interests of each particular colony. If we wish the federal government to be respected; if we wish the federal constitution to be based upon equity and justice, those who differ from the proposals of the hon. members, Sir Samuel Griffith and Mr. Barton, with regard to placing the states in a position of fair representation in the senate, must yield at once, and with the best possible grace. The whole question of federation will come to grief, and be a lamentable failure, if the suggestions of those hon. members are not carried out. The very difficulty which has presented itself to this Convention, at the threshold of our meeting, was one of the main difficulties which pressed themselves upon the great men who, a hundred years ago, met to settle a constitution for the United States. I have no doubt that every argument which has been used on both sides in this Convention was freely used by the able men who debated the question a hundred years ago, and a settlement was arrived at by giving effect to the view advocated by Sir Samuel Griffith, that the smaller states especially should have a guarantee of security by the method which he proposes; and unless such a compromise had been made in the case of the American Constitution there would have been no constitution for the United States at all. As far as I can read, a difficulty arose upon the very question which we have been debating here. The state of Connecticut took up the running and in a book which is in the hands of hon. members, "The Civil Government of the United States," by Fisk, I find a short passage which strongly illustrates what was argued then and what has been argued here; and it shows the wisdom of the conclusion arrived at by the men who established the American Constitution, which has borne the battle and the breeze for 100 years. Personally, I have an objection to the use of quotations from books; but this is one bearing so strongly upon the issues involved here that I am sure hon. members will permit me to read it:-This feature of the House of Representatives caused the smaller states in the convention to oppose the whole scheme of constructing a new government. They were determined that great and small states should have equal weight in congress. Their steadfast opposition threatened to ruin everything, when, fortunately, a method of compromise was discovered. It was intended that the national legislature, in imitation of the state legislatures, should have an upper house, or senate, and at first the advocates of a strong national government proposed that the senate also should represent population, thus differing from the lower house only in the way in which we have seen that it generally differed in the several states. But it happened that in the state of Connecticut the custom was peculiar. There it had always been the custom to elect  the governor and upper house by a majority vote of the whole people, while for each township there was an equality of representatives in the lower house. The Connecticut delegation in the convention therefore, being familiar with a legislature in which the two houses were composed on different principles, suggested a compromise, "Let the House of Representatives," they said, "represent the people-We propose to do that here.and let the senate represent the states-That is the proposal of the hon. member, Sir Samuel Griffith.Let all the states, great and small, be represented equally in the federal senate." Such was the famous Connecticut compromise. Without it the convention would probably have broken up without accomplishing anything. When it was adopted half the work of making the new government was done; for the small states having had their fears thus allayed by an assurance that they were to be equally represented in the senate, no longer opposed the work, but cooperated in it most zealously.It appears to me that the quotation I have just read pretty well solves the difficulty which has arisen in the early debates of this Convention. The question is: Will you give the small states a guarantee of security against the larger states, who may outvote them if you establish the representation in the senate upon the basis of population. Let us take, for example, the small colony of Western Australia. If its representation in the senate is based upon population, and not on equal rights with other colonies, that colony would simply be snuffed out of existence by the larger colonies. Under such a state of things as that, is it to be supposed for one moment that the smaller colonies of Australasia could contemplate joining the federation? Representation on the basis of population seems to be fair and equitable so far as the house of representatives is concerned; but you must give to the smaller colonies, in their representation in the senate, equal rights with those enjoyed by the larger colonies. Unless that is done, the whole scheme will come to grief from a want of that spirit of compromise, equity, and justice which ought to be shown in dealing with the smaller states. From my point of view, I think that that question has been fairly thrashed out, and that this Convention will, when a division is taken upon that particular view of the question, be almost unanimous in doing justice and equity to those smaller states, without whose assistance the idea of federation would be but a myth. It ought to be our duty, in any proposals which we make for legislation by the various colonies, to endeavour to create a strong, powerful senate, which will have the confidence of the people out of doors. We can only do that by giving a guarantee and an assurance to the smaller colonies that we shall not leave them in such a position that they will be almost annexed to the larger colonies, or simply wiped out of existence. The arguments put forward by the gentlemen I have named, and others who have spoken on this particular phase of the question, have, to my mind, been conclusive, and we must do justice if we are to expect anything like union or federation of the various colonies. In the case of New South Wales and Victoria we have two large and powerful colonies. In the house of representatives they will be enormously represented-that seems to be fair and just. I might even put Queensland in conjunction with New South Wales and Victoria. In the case of South Australia, with its moderate population; in the case of Western Australia, with its very small population; in the case of the hundred and odd thousand who may be represented in Tasmania, we must consult their interests, render to them a full measure of justice and equity, and establish a strong and powerful senate, which will do justice to them, and which, at the same time, will give security to the people at large. That phase of the question has been well thrashed out, and in the minds of this Convention I think there will be but one conclu-  sion. But it appears to me that after all, however interesting the debate has been, and however instructive-and I admit it has been to myself very instructive, on account of the views so ably put forward by the speakers who have preceded me - I think we are rather in advance of the real subject when we deal with that phase before taking in hand the other important issues as a basis upon which federation shall take place. Sir Thomas McIlwraith, to use a figurative, though not very elegant expression, took the bull by the horns very boldly, and he told the Convention-and I am certain his remarks met with the approval of most members of the Convention-that there was a question which should be considered in advance of that of state rights. Are we to understand that is to be the bedrock upon which federation is to take place? The bedrock upon which federation is to take place appears to my mind to be that the Convention must agree among themselves, clearly and definitely, to lay down the lines of the future fiscal policy of Australia, and that must not be done by inference, but be clearly laid down as one of the principles of federation, before we can proceed one step further in our discussion. Of course there are other questions which will arise as we proceed in this debate. While we are here sitting in th
Who says this?
Mr. DIBBS: 
The Sydney Horning Herald of 1877; and I may tell my hon. friend, Colonel Smith, that the Sydney Morning Herald voices the opinions of the moderate and temperate people of New South Wales.Until, therefore, Victoria is converted to a free-trade policy, or can convert her neighbours to one of protection, there can be no federal union between them.And I believe that is the voice of the whole of New South Wales. I leave the members from the other great colonies, and even from the smaller colonies, to speak for themselves on that point. The article goes on to say:This is a vital question which must be agreed upon in advance, and could not, as Mr. Forster appears to imagine, be left to be fought out afterwards. Now, sir, we are engaged upon the consideration of this great work, and it appears to me that Victoria has triumphed with regard to the principles of protection throughout the whole of Australasia, until, at the present moment, she has attacked the citadel of free-trade, New South Wales. Step by step, and one by one, the principles of protection started twenty-five years ago by Victoria have maintained their own, and Victoria has gradually drawn South Australia, Tasmania, New Zealand-I do not know much about Western Australia, because she is young in the business-but she has drawn Queensland also into the same line of policy, the wisdom of which has been acknowledged by the statesmen of the other colonies, and she has at last approached to make one last convert in order to complete the chain. And now, Mr. President, I must congratulate you upon being the last convert to protection. You, sir, plainly indicate by the resolutions you have moved that you are the last convert to protection, and that the free-trade party can receive at your hands its death warrant-its nunc dimittis, I may call it. Free-trade in this colony has received from this Convention, or from its President, the Premier of the supposed free-trade colony of New South Wales, its death warrant. It appears to me that Victoria has triumphed, that what the Herald in 1877 foreshadowed as the lines upon which federation might possibly take place, namely, the conversion of the other colonies to protection, has been accomplished, and we find the Premier of the only free-trade colony prepared to sink the fiscal question in advance and leave it to be settled by the federal parliament when federation is established. I believe that the people of New South Wales can look upon you as the latest convert to the wisdom of the policy of protection, which in twenty-five years has pushed Victoria into the proud position in  which she stands to-day. This fiscal question has taken, I gather from some of the speeches which have been delivered here, an extraordinary turn. To my surprise, I have gathered that Victoria, in discussing the fiscal question in this Convention, is asking for guarantees to secure the protection of her vested interests. Now, in a footrace, where one of the rivals has an advantage of 25 yards start in 100, one would not ask for an assurance that the man who had the 25 yards start should win; or, when on the turf, horses are handicapped by weights, one would not ask for a guarantee that the horse with the heaviest weight should "play the Carbine" in the business. But it appears to me that Victoria has had the effrontery to come here, and by the mouths of some of her delegates to tell us at once that she, in any settlement of this question, requires to have guarantees for the protection of her vested interests, though one would think that, having the advantage of twenty-five years' start on the whole of Australasia, she would not require anything more. We are prepared to give her the advantage which the energy and pluck of her people and their determination to lead the whole of Australia, have gained for her in the twenty-five years' start which she has had; but we are not prepared to give her more than that. If we are going to deal with this matter in the liberal spirit suggested by the press, if we are going to have, as the 2nd resolution puts it, inter-colonial free-trade, and, if federation is to come within a reasonable time, inter-colonial free-trade must come at once, and the colonies of South Australia, Queensland, Tasmania, and New South Wales will be the biggest victims, and will make the largest sacrifice. So far, the Parliament of New South Wales has only given a sort of half-hearted approval of even the meeting of this Convention, and the people have not yet been consulted upon it at all, though in due time they will be consulted and will have the advantage of the public education which they are now receiving upon the big questions which concern them in giving their decision. But coming back to this question of meeting each other in a friendly spirit, what in the name of reason and right does Victoria require more than the fact that she has had the markets of pretty well the whole of Australasia open to her for the last twenty-five years?
Mr. GORDON: 
As much as she can get!
Mr. DIBBS: 
That is the weakness of human nature. The cry offer, considering the size of the colony, and the almost juvenile manufactures which it possesses, and New South Wales is prepared to give to Victoria all the advantages of her twenty-five years' start, and to stand shoulder to shoulder with her and do the best we can in honest competition. But I should like the hon. member, Mr. Gillies, who I believe will speak to-day, and whose speech will have an atten-  tive hearing from the members of the Convention and from the people of the various colonies, to be perfectly clear and straight, and if the speeches which have been delivered do not voice the sentiments of the people of Victoria, let him, as an enlightened statesman, give us the assurance that Victoria wants nothing more than she now possesses, and that upon the question of federation she will ask for no other advantages than that which she has gained by the twenty-five years' advance in statesmanship which has been made by the people who have ruled her destiny. I shall listen to my hon. friend's speech with great interest. From conversation which I have had with her delegates, I gather that South Australia is prepared to take a liberal view on this question, and we ask Victoria to come in now and to throw in her lot with us. If we can get Victoria to say that she is prepared to lay the foundation-stone of a possible federation by agreeing at once to a customs union, in advance, if need be, of the settlement of the federation question-if she will at once agree to throw in her lot with us, one of the greatest difficulties in the way of federation will be removed. But there are other big questions besides this question of protection. The big and difficult question of the rights to the Murray River will have to be settled in a spirit of liberal compromise. It is one of those questions which no doubt federation would be the means of settling for ever, and a question which Victorian statesman no doubt will keep in their minds'-eye, and which the people of New South Wales will always have before them in coming to any adjustment of those bones of contention which have by our territorial boundaries been allowed to come between us. The magnitude of the question was not seen at the time; but it has developed until it has become a cause of discord almost between the colonies. The fiscal question, however, appears to me to be the kernel of the whole business. It was in 1884; it is so to-day; and it will remain the principal barrier, or, to use the expression of the Hon. James Service, the lion in the path, to anything like federation, unless Victoria gives a bold and generous assurance to this Convention that she is prepared to deal in the same liberal spirit as the two great colonies of South Australia and Queensland with the people of New South Wales. This being accomplished, other matters will fall in like a piece of mosaic. Having laid the foundation-stone, your superstructure will rise with some prospect of being a permanent building; but you will never advance one foot towards the accomplishment of federation so long as the fiscal question remains unsettled, and the whole of the colonies of Australasia have the assurance by the resolutions proposed by the President that free-trade New South Wales is prepared to make the fiscal question second to that of federation. The other day a letter was published giving the opinion of Sir Hercules Robinson upon this question; and when I read that letter I regretted that the hon. gentleman who had addressed Sir Hercules in the first instance had not published the letter which he wrote. It is a very important link in enabling one to comprehend what Sir Hercules Robinson meant. But what did Sir Hercules tell the Premier of this colony? He said, "Give up free-trade; make a sacrifice of free-trade to secure federation for the people of Australia," And it appears to me that that is the course which you, sir, have taken. You have accepted the advice; and it must be the result of your own large experience that what has hitherto divided the great colonies of Victoria and New South Wales, and has kept the other colonies away from New South Wales, has been the division in feeling with regard to the fiscal question. Now, what position has New South Wales occupied  with regard to the other colonies? She has been practically the mother of all the other colonies. From her loins have mainly sprung the bone and sinew of the colonies which now surround her, and she can fairly look upon the surrounding colonies practically as her own children.
Mr. GORDON: 
Some of them!
Mr. DIBBS: 
South Australia underwent a different, I may say a Caesarian, operation in its birth. The inheritance which its people now possess was cut out from the vitals of the parent state. But, taking the colonies of Australasia as a whole, we may say that New South Wales is in the position of a parent towards them. Her children have grown up vigorous and strong around her, and they have found that she has not been a hard step-mother to them, but rather a loving mother. She has been the recipient of the manufactures and the produce of her children, until, with the hautiness and robustness of Australian youth, they have almost crushed the old parent out of existence. New South Wales has been an affectionate mother to the people of the other colonies, inasmuch as she has received into her markets, under the spurious system of free-trade, a large bulk of their produce. And that brings me to the very agreeable speech which fell from the hon. member, Captain Russell. Now, the position of New Zealand in regard to this fiscal question is very unique The hon. member, Captain Russell, told us that New Zealand was prepared to receive the embraces of the people of New South Wales, and indeed of the whole of Australia; but when federation approaches anything like realisation she will probably find herself in the position of those states of the American union which at first refused to be a part of the union, and which compelled the states already in the union to give them-not the tender embraces of brotherhood, but the hug of the bear, before they saw their way to join the union. New South Wales has been the principal receiver of the produce of the vast granaries of New Zealand; and I have no doubt New Zealand will find it to her advantage to remain outside of the federation, if she can still have the ports of New South Wales, under our spurious free-trade system, and to the detriment of our own farmers, open to her. She would no doubt like to evade the responsibility of federation, and at the same time have our markets open to her. But, if ever the Australian colonies, as separate from the rest of Australasia, unite in a bond of inter-colonial free-trade, it will be most unjust to the whole of Australia if New Zealand is allowed to keep the advantage which she now has, of free-trade with New South Wales, thus having all the colonies open to her produce. New Zealand is a convert to protection; she has taken the bit into her own mouth, and has left the free-trade course in which New South started her. She has struck out on the lines of Victoria, and, as one of the converted colonies, she must join with us, or be left out in the cold, if federation takes place. We cannot afford to give her the advantages of our markets, unless she joins with us in the federation. I say that with every respect for our New Zealand friends, whose presence here has lent a charm, to a large extent, to the proceedings of this Convention. Before going further, I should like to say a word or two on the resolutions themselves. I have no doubt that they, in due time, will be carried pro forma; and I have no doubt that the real squabble will take place when we go into Committee, and when it is proposed to amend the resolutions so as to put them into practical shape. On behalf of New South Wales, I would point out that the 1st resolution which you, Mr. President, have proposed:That the powers and privileges and territorial rights of the several existing colonies shall remain intact-  has been put forward mainly as a sop to the people of New South Wales. There has been a desire on the part of the framer of these resolutions to tell the people of New South Wales that in joining the federation the object will be to preserve to them their territorial rights and all the advantages of their present position. We must not, however, be unmindful of the fact that there can be no federal government without, to a large extent, the sacrifice of some portion of state rights; and when the word "provinces" is used in this debate, I ignore its existence altogether. We have been, as it were, chaffed out of our very existence. Those of us who have spoken within the walls of this building, or who have spoken out of doors to our constituents, and have endeavoured, in discussing the federal question, to take a strong view of the position in regard to the defence of the rights of New South Wales, have been pulled to pieces, and called provincialists. I object, in connection with the independent state of New South Wales-a state as independent as any in the world, even England itself, so far as the freedom of our position is concerned-to the word "province." There may be something more dignified in the use of the word "state." We are not going to become provinces. I do not think we are going to give up the individual rights and liberties which we possess, and which those who have gone before us have fought for, to become mere provinces under a federal form of government. We may take the more dignified form of "states." Whilst we have endeavoured to put before the people of New South Wales, in these resolutions, a sort of opiate, something assuring to their minds that in joining a federal union we give up nothing of our territorial rights, words have been inserted in them which I shall do my utmost in Committee to strike out-except in respect to such surrenders as may be agreed upon as necessary and incidental to the power and authority of the national federal government.I do not know the meaning of these words, and no hon. gentleman who has yet spoken has given any clear interpretation of them. It is sufficient for us, in enunciating a principle upon which the basis of a constitution shall be prepared, to see that the territorial rights and privileges of each colony shall be preserved to each state but when you come to consider the condition of a surrender, and the question of the power of enforcing such surrender is placed in the hands of the federal government, then your provinces or your states will be no party to the proceeding.
Mr. GILLIES: 
The resolution does not say that!
Mr. DIBBS: 
Well, I shall be very glad to have any other meaning placed upon it. It will be for the federal government to claim, and I take it, for the federal government to enforce.
Mr. McMILLAN: 
The word "surrenders" carries its own meaning!
Mr. DIBBS: 
I think, in a resolution in which we are asked to affirm the principles upon which the constitution shall be constructed, that the word "powers" in connection with the expression, "powers and privileges and territorial rights," might be omitted altogether. I dread dealing with the expression "territorial rights," as it may imply the taking from the people of New South Wales that territory which lies in such close contiguity to other and powerful states, and which we may say in all charity, and in the mildest possible form, they possibly covet. I have no doubt South Australia would like an adjustment of territorial boundary in order to take in Broken Hill. We have heard-and the idea comes from the preaching of the Victorian press and Victorian statesmen-that an equal adjustment of territorial rights might be taken to mean  the annexation of Riverina to Victoria, and equally the modest colony of Queensland, on our north, might find that their capital, Brisbane, might be strengthened to a large extent by a certain portion of the territory of New South Wales down to the Clarence River being merged into Southern Queensland. These are the questions which come before the minds of the people of New South Wales, and upon which this Convention will have to be perfectly clear. There must be no surrender of territorial rights in any shape or form, save in connection with the reconstruction of states in the future, or in connection with the construction of new states. Such division or surrender for the creation of new states should only be by the will and consent of a two-thirds majority of the people. Resolutions 2 and 3 deal with the question of trade intercourse, and follow, as a matter of course, upon the creation of a federation. There can be no federation of these colonies, no federal form of government, unless there is unrestricted free-trade throughout the whole of the colonies. That goes without saying; and the power vested in the federal government of imposing outside customs duties is also natural and right enough. The two resolutions, taken together, mean, by inference, that there shall be unrestricted free-trade between the various parties to the federal government compact, but there must be protection against the outside world. We now come to a most dangerous point in connection with the proceedings of this Convention. I hope that the 4th resolution, dealing with the question of military and naval defence, will receive the most anxious consideration of the delegates. I hope that the words which fell last evening from the lips of the hon. member, Sir George Grey - words which bear the weight of great experience - will be taken to heart by those who may form the federal government. The question of creating a standing army is one which, to my mind, is almost more repulsive than the question of readjustment of territorial boundaries. It means the existence in our midst of a certain number of idle men - men sharpening their knives and their swords for the first fitting opportunity of fleshing them on the people of their own country, because we have no other enemies. We in Australia - federated Australia, I may take it, because the matter is one which applies to the whole - have no enemies within our borders; we have no Indians to dispute with us the possession of the soil; we have no powerful Maori race to fight, as was once the case in New Zealand, for the territory the right to which belonged to the Maoris themselves. We have no enemies within, and the only thing we have to fear is the possibility of any assault on the mother country by her enemies from without, unless indeed the creation of a standing army proves a menace to the people of Australia by the existence of an armed force for unlawful purposes. This question of the creation of a military force is one of the blots upon these resolutions. We want no military force within New South Wales. All we want to do is to make every man who is either a native of the soil, or one of ourselves by reason of his taking up his residence amongst us, prepare to resist possible invasion from without. Who are our enemies? Who are our enemies but the enemies of England, and they, so long as we remain under the Crown, will be dealt with by an outer barrier, an outer bulwark in the defence of Australia, in the shape of the navy of Old England. But we have no enemies within, and there is no necessity to fasten the curse of a standing army upon us. As was pointed out by the hon. member, Sir George Grey, yesterday, in his interesting speech, we have no necessity to keep a large standing army at a large cost to the people of the country,  when we have no enemies with whom they will have to fight. Our own police are quite sufficient for the preservation of order within. In the event of invasion from without, so long as we remain under the Crown, our enemies, being the enemies of England, will be dealt with before ever an attempt is made to invade these shores; and when the day of invasion comes the people of this country will rise as one man to defend their hearths and homes from any possible aggressor. I look upon the question of the creation of a military power within a territory under the Crown as a menace to the people who are to continue as British subjects. We have been sent here by our various parliaments to frame a constitution under the Crown-under the Crown, bear in mind. That is the idea which has been put forward in every speech that has been made. I presume, then, that the members of the Convention are prepared at once to give the go-by altogether to the idea of imperial federation. So long as we remain in our present position as individual colonies, we are imperially federated, and we can be imperially federated in no stronger manner than in connection with our relation to the mother country. We are as much imperially federated as the people living in the cities of London, Liverpool, Manchester, or other large centres of population. We are a portion of the British Crown, joined together by the most solemn ties and obligations; and we have to bear the brunt of any misfortune which may fall upon us in connection with any attack upon our shores by reason of our enemies being the common enemies of England. We have already made certain provision, partially of a federal character, to assist the Imperial Government in the protection of our shores from without; but let us set our faces as a young nation-if I may use the word "nation" in advance-against standing armies; let us set our face once and for ever against the creation of anything like a military despotism. We are met here under the Crown, and I must say that, as one possessing a slight tinge of republican notions, as one who sees that the future of Australia is to be what was prophesied of it fifty years ago, by poets who have written of what the future of Australia is to be-having a certain tinge of republicanism in my nature, the result naturally of my being a descendant of an Englishman, I was surprised to find a gentleman occupying a position under the Crown proposing what 100 years ago would have been simply regarded as high treason. Why, the other day the hon. member, Mr. Munro, made a proposal with regard to one phase of the question which made me ejaculate, "One strand of the painter has gone."
Mr. MUNRO: 
What was that?
Mr. DIBBS: 
The hon. member proposed to take from us, as British subjects, the chartered right which we possess of appeal to the Crown.
Mr. MUNRO: 
I did not. I spoke in the other direction!
Mr. DIBBS: 
The hon. member spoke of establishing our appeal court, and of doing away with the necessity of appealing to the Privy Council. The hon. member suggested that we should have our appeal court, and that there would be no necessity for sending cases to the Privy Council of England.
Mr. MUNRO: 
I said the reverse!
Mr. FITZGERALD: 
The hon. member said the opposite!
Hon. MEMBERS: 
Hear, hear!
Mr. DIBBS: 
I am very glad to take the hon. gentleman's statement, that he said the reverse. I find, then, that I have done the hon. member an injustice. The reason the matter made an impression upon my mind at the moment was the speech of the hon. member, Sir Samuel Griffith, who told us, with his astute  knowledge as a lawyer, that his mind was still open on the subject, that he was prepared to hear arguments on both sides of the question before making up his mind whether to agree to the establishment of an appeal court. However, if I have done the hon. member, Mr. Munro, an injustice, I certainly apologise. But the hon. member, Mr. Playford, took a more extreme view still. He proposes to take part in the formation of a constitution which will take the right of veto, or of approval or dissent on the part of the Crown to our bills, away from the Crown altogether. That was clear enough, and that brought forth from me the involuntary ejaculation, "There's another strand of the painter gone!" And what did I hear from our revered friend from New Zealand, Sir George Grey? I heard a proposal of a still more audacious character. He threw out a suggestion for our adoption that we should stipulate for the election of a governor-general to preside over the federated colonies, to be elected by the people of those colonies. In God's name, what then is to become of the Crown? The matter reminds me very much of the story of "Ginx's Baby." After they had been squabbling about the "territorial rights" of that unfortunate baby until it had been kicked overboard, the writer concluded with these extraordinary words, "Good God, what has become of the baby?" When one hon. member proposes to cut the Crown into mince meat-when the hon. member, Mr. Playford, would deprive the Crown of its right of vetoing a bill, and when the hon. member, Sir George Grey, would take from the Crown the right of nominating, and give us the power of electing, our governor-general, what is to become of the Crown? What is the Crown to be? Are we to send to the Fiji Islands for a block of wood which they use as one of their gods, and set that up in the capital of Australia, and say, "This is the representative of the Crown, without power or right of veto, and of our own election"?
Mr. PLAYFORD: What power has the Crown now?
Mr. DIBBS: 
If the Crown has no power now, what does the hon. member propose to take away? The Crown has the power of vetoing our bills, and showed its power last year when it vetoed our Divorce Bill. We are gradually cutting that "crimson thread of kinship"-the words have become historical-we are gradually whittling away the powers of the Crown and creating for the future of Australia what the hon. member, Mr. Playford, is, perhaps, anxious to create, namely, the republic of the united states of Australia. That is, I have no doubt, what we are coming to. Without poaching from the unprotected preserves of my hon. friend, Captain Russell, who rather usurped the position which hitherto I have held in this chamber, of being the only legitimate quoter of the sacred book, I think really that, after all, "out of the fulness of the heart the mouth speaketh." Out of the fullness of the heart of republicanism came the proposal to subvert the authority and dignity of the Crown, to cut the last link of connection with the Crown, and to establish the republic of Australia. That is what we are coming to, and it is the inevitable destiny of the people of this great country. When England sent her pioneers to subdue the wilds of Australia, to civilise them and to make "the desert rejoice and blossom as the rose"-when she planted her colonies in this country she planted them with that germ and spirit of independence which must, as time rolls on, develop into the establishment of a great republic. The cubs of the lion will, in due time, play the lion's part; and I was intensely amused to find that that young cub, South Australia, represented by my hon. friend, Mr. Play-  ford, has solved the whole question of converting the authority of the Crown into a myth. What we are doing to-day is preparing step by step for that grand future which is to come; and when that day arrives, it will be not to the discredit nor to the injury of England, but for England's greater strength and security, when she in the southern seas-separated as we are by such a vast expanse-shall have created, as foreshadowed by the hon. member, Mr. Playford, not a dependency, but a nation of her own people, free and independent of the Crown. That is the boldest way in which to put the question. It was barely touched on before, but it was the honest conviction of the hon. member, Mr. Playford, and the hon. member, Sir George Grey, who pointed out that the people of this country would no longer, especially as time rolls on and develops still further the pluck and independence of the people, remain as they are; but that in the future this country must become a nation of itself, in alliance with the old country. Will any of us here say that it was to the loss of England that America separated from the control of the parent state, or that that event was not in the interest of humanity, was not for the benefit of the human race? And will anybody tell me that it will be against the interest of humanity, of the British race, or of England herself, that in due time these colonies shall become one great, united Australia, as friends and allies of the motherland? That is our future, and what we are doing here step by step to-day is laying the foundation of the inevitable which is to come. We talk about making a constitution which is to last fifty or a hundred years. Where shall we be in fifty or a hundred years? I do not suppose that I shall see my hon. friend, Sir John Bray, fifty years hence sitting in that corner; he might be elevated to the president's chair; or be president of the republic itself. But we are laying the foundation, and step by step are following in the lines of a great nation, and in due time we shall become what America has become, a separate, free, and independent state. That is what we are gradually doing. We may be to a certain extent working in fog and darkness; but that will be the outcome of the whole question-of all our arguments, of all our debates, of all the thinking of the people of this country. I am as much in touch with the native-born population of Australia as is any man in the country; and I feel that I express their sentiments when I say that from the germ of liberty implanted within us, by our forefathers spring the aspirations which will forbid us to remain bound in alliance except as one friendly nation with another, always with that special respect that should be paid to the people, of the fatherland. I am afraid that I have wearied hon. members as far as I have gone; but it appears to me that before going again over a little bit of the ground, I have said sufficient to show that I shall oppose the military spirit, both inside this Convention and outside the walls of this chamber. Whenever I have the opportunity I will do my utmost to cut down the military spirit and to instil into the people of this land a love of their homes, and also the necessity of defending them in the only legitimate manner. As the, the hon. member, Sir George Grey, said, either yesterday or in his speech the other day at the Town Hall, we should educate our people up to all of this, and especially in New South Wales, where we are giving the people of the country practically a free education-and it should be common to all Australia - we should instil into the minds of our children the necessity for training, and, as a quid pro quo for that free education, we should demand from them a certain amount of proficiency in the use of arms, which of itself would lay the basis of a military organisation for the purposes  of defence only. When we have done that we should still come nearer to that great future foreshadowed by Wentworth when he spoke not of these colonies being dependencies of any fatherland or motherland-dependencies of any state whatever, but when he used words almost equal in eloquence to the peroration of my hon. friend, Mr. Fitzgerald, last night. When he spoke of "Australasia with flag unfurled-a new Britannia in another world," the idea was uppermost in his mind, as a native born Australian-as it is in the mind of nearly every native born Australian now, and also in that of those who have cast in their lot among us-that the future of Australia must be "a new Britannia" with her own flag. We have had to repletion the building of castles in the air treated to the prospect of royal courts, presided over, probably, by royal princes, where our wealthy citizens shall flock around, and enjoy all the pleasures which surround a royal court; but after all when we come to the bed rock, we find that the national spirit of the rising generation of Australia is instinct with freedom which will impel our people at the earliest possible moment to form a nation of their own. That is the aspiration, instinct, and spirit, I hope, of young Australia, and we are here helping that spirit, according to the speeches of my hon. friend, Mr. Playford, and others, by building a constitution like that of the United States, which is to last 100 years. It appears to me that, to use a nautical expression, these resolutions are wrong side up. We ought to have begun building our ship by laying the keel, I think we have been putting aloft the top-gallant and royal yards without having regard to the structure upon which everything is to depend. We ought to have started by affirming, first of all, what we propose in the shape of a federal parliament - by pointing out that we would have two houses of legislature. In due time we should have settled among ourselves what powers the senate should have - it is pretty well agreed what the house of representatives should be. We should then have defined clearly and distinctly what the federal rights should be-but we are not doing that we should state clearly and above board what the state rights should be, and, having done that, we should define-and the people of this country will not be satisfied until we do define-the basis of our fiscal policy, as being one of the conditions which should follow at the earliest possible moment in the programme. And then, as far as New South Wales is concerned, we must pay some little consideration as to which city is to be the capital of the future empire. Where is that capital to be? Is it to be in Hobart? Tasmania is out of the field. Is it to be in Western Australia?
An Hon. MEMBER: Yes!
Mr. DIBBS: 
We have lent a hand in endeavouring to obtain for Western Australia free and independent government; but no city in that colony is hardly fit to be the capital of Australia. Will the capital be in South Australia? Of course, if I put the question to Victorians they will say that the capital should be in Victoria.
An Hon. MEMBER: No!
Mr. DIBBS: 
Then they are casting it at once upon New South Wales. I am sure Queensland has no ambition for it. But just one word, in all seriousness, with regard to the question of the capital. This question will have to be dealt with by this Convention.
Hon. MEMBERS: No!
Mr. DIBBS: 
Gentlemen, when they say "no," are speaking with a tender sympathy for their own colony.
Colonel SMITH: 
Was the hon. gentleman ever in Ballarat? That is the place for the capital!
Mr. DIBBS: 
Yes, I have been in Ballarat, and I do not know a better place to  be the capital of Victoria; but we cannot make it the capital of Australia. It is a fit place to be the capital of Victoria, but not for the whole of the colonies. I am speaking in all seriousness. I am speaking now for New South Wales. I have veered round from the position from which I started. I stand here as a representative of New South Wales, and the people of New South Wales will not lend themselves to any scheme of federation, when the question is submitted to them, unless first of all the fiscal question be settled-not the details of the tariff, but the principle-for it must be clearly defined what the fiscal policy of the great country shall be. But there is the other question upon which the people of New South Wales will require to know the opinion of hon. members, namely, as to where the capital of this new federation is to be; and it may be worth while to point out that there is one spot alone favoured by nature, favoured by the great Creator himself-where that capital should be, where, if we are to be a naval power, the centre of the naval operations should be, where nature has planted boundless fields of coal for naval purposes as well as for Australian manufactures, where we, the parent state, have boundless resources, and where all the advantages of beauty point to one place on the face of Australia, and in favour of which hon. members of this Convention will have to make up their minds before our proceedings close.
Hon. MEMBERS: No!
Mr. DIBBS: 
Oh, yes. There was a certain man went on a journey between Jericho and Jerusalem. Well, the people of New South Wales do not propose to take that journey, but to have the road marked out with suitable lights.
Mr. PLAYFORD: 
There is a very good road between Jerusalem and Jericho!
Mr. DIBBS: 
Yes; but the hon. member knows what became of the unfortunate man who took it. That is one of the questions which it is no use our shirking. Now, I speak on behalf of New South Wales, because I am sworn to no master but New South Wales; I know no other master but the people of New South Wales. When the day comes it will not be an open question more than the fiscal question; but will have to be settled not so much in the interests of New South Wales as in the interests of the whole of Australia. If we are to go into a federation, we must know on what lines we are to go. We must know where the capital city is to be situated.
Sir JOHN DOWNER: 
No!
Mr. PLAYFORD: 
Let the people who are elected decide that!
Mr. DIBBS: 
There is a difference of opinion. Remember that, after all, we are only here acting without the authority of our masters. Our masters are behind the scenes in all this business. However much we may thrash out this big question, our masters, and our masters alone, will be the people who will settle that question.
Mr. PLAYFORD: 
They will settle it when the first federal council is elected!
Mr. DIBBS: 
Oh, yes! This is the bomb-shell which I kept in reserve: are hon. members prepared to take that question, and add it to the resolutions upon which we are to build up our constitution?
Mr. MUNRO: 
We are not authorised!
Mr. DIBBS: 
I know that. But New South Wales wants to know something about that question. We want unity. We want the river Murray question settled. I would ask my hon. friend, Mr. Gillies, whether he is authorised to settle the river Murray question?
Mr. ADYE DOUGLAS: 
No!
Mr. DIBBS: 
But the hon. member would be very glad, no doubt, to take it as an act of compromise. However, whether we are or are not authorised to settle that question, we have to face our masters upon  the whole questions involved in these resolutions and other resolutions that must be submitted, and, take my word for it, speaking on behalf of the people of New South Wales, the question of the capital is one which will weigh enormously with them in giving their adhesion to any system of federation.
Mr. PLAYFORD: 
And with the other colonies as well!
Mr. DIBBS: 
And with the other colonies, I have no doubt. But we are differently situated. History gives us no guide in the selection of a federal capital. In the case of the United States of America it was the result of a compromise. In no other part of the world can I read in history of any place where the question of the federal capital was settled on the lines which the United States adopted. I am very much mistaken if the people of New South Wales, which, by reason of its wealth, its position, its resources, its population, will not claim to have as powerful a voice in that matter as many of the other parts of Australia put together. However, these are questions to be settled, and I have no doubt that the generous spirit of compromise which has so far distinguished the debates will be extended even to a fair consideration of that question. In due time, if no other hon. member takes the lead, I shall test the question by proposing it as one of the cardinal points of the new constitution. These resolutions, Mr. President, will be submitted to a committee, and in Committee of the Whole I reserve to myself the right of amending them to the fullest possible extent in the direction of the lines which I have indicated, and shall endeavour to the fullest extent to meet the neighbouring colonies in that liberal spirit, that federal spirit of compromise, which you shadowed forth in your opening address. But I fear that if New South Wales is to be a factor in the new constitution, or in the federation, there will have to be a generous concession made to her people, and she must have at least an equal voice in the discussion. I thank hon. members for bearing with me so long, for I fear that I have wearied them; but I have indicated in a hasty fashion my views of the labours which I think this Convention may perform. Its ultimate outcome should be the building up in the future the great and glorious empire of Australia.
