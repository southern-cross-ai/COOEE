Our ships will perhaps no longer be able to carry our gold and wool to Europe; and gold and wool will fall, as cotton did in the Confederate States of America during the blockade, to a nominal price.  They will no longer be able to bring us our ordinary supplies from Yorkshire, Birmingham, China, or the Mauritius; and some of the prime necessities of civilization will either be unattainable, or will reach a famine price. It may be said, no doubt, that England is mistress of the seas, and will be able to protect her commerce and ours. But France and America have been making enormous expenditure and immense exertions for years past to be in a position to compete for this supremacy. Even if it be admitted that England would be able to protect the great highway to Europe by the Cape, will she be able to guard the Northern Pacific, or to save the great Australian cities from fleets stationed at San Francisco or New Caledonia? We have read - many of us at all events - reports upon the defence of this country, which lay down in the most dogmatic terms the exact course that an invading enemy would take - where he would land, and where he would by no possibility land; but, for my part, I have very slight faith in dogmatisms of this nature. I believe, with the French wit, that the only thing we can count upon with tolerable certainty to happen is what nobody foresaw. If a French Lord Dundonald, or an American Paul Jones, made his appearance on our coast, he would put all these pedantic theories to flight by doing the exact thing which it was foretold would never happen. As most of the members of this House have become members of it since the federal question was last under consideration, I will state, very briefly, what has been hitherto done in relation to it. In the first session of the first Parliament of Victoria - fourteen years ago - a committee was appointed, on my motion, to report whether the federation of the colonies was desirable, and, if desirable, how it could be brought about. Many of the members of that committee are here no longer. Some of them are in Europe, some of them are members of the other House, several of them are dead. Only three remain, but happily of these three one is the present Chief Secretary, and the other is the present Attorney-General.  The report of that select committee was submitted to this House in November, 1857, and adopted by it. It was shortly afterwards submitted to the Legislative Council, and adopted by it; and both Houses arrived at resolutions to the effect that such a conference should be held, and that it should consist of three members - two from the Assembly and one from the Council - of each Legislature in the Australian colonies. The proposal was communicated to the neighbouring colonies, and was received with the greatest favour. In South Australia, both Houses of the Legislature accepted and affirmed our proposal, and proceeded to select delegates to attend at Melbourne, which was agreed to be the place of conference. They selected as their delegates, the then Chief Secretary, now Sir Richard Hanson, Chief Justice of the colony, and Mr. Torrens, then leader of the Opposition, and now one of the representatives of Cambridge in the House of Commons.  
In Tasmania, the subject was taken up with equal promptness and favour; both Houses passed resolutions assenting to the proposal, and also proceeded to appoint delegates to represent them at the conference. Queensland had not then come into existence as an independent colony, but it did shortly after-wards, when communications having been opened with the Chief Secretary, that gentleman wrote a letter stating that, when the conference was held, Queensland would gladly co-operate with the other colonies. Then, with respect to New South Wales - which may he called the mother colony - the Legislative Council of that colony appointed a select committee, consisting of the most eminent men in the House - including Sir Alfred Stephen, Sir William Burton, and Mr. Deas Thomson - who made a most careful inquiry into the subject, and concluded by recommending the Parliament of New South Wales to accept the proposal made by Victoria. Thus the proposal received assent from every legislative body in Australia, except the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales; and there the matter had proceeded so far as to be on the business paper, when a political crisis occurred, a change of Government took place, Mr. Cowper came into office, and he signalized his assumption of power by declaring against what had been universally accepted, insisting that the time was not ripe for such a proceeding, and stating that he was not prepared to take any part in appointing delegates. A general election took place shortly afterwards, and Mr. Cowper was strong enough in the new Parliament to prevent any action being taken at that time. It then became a question with the Victorian committee what should be done under the circumstances whether conference should be held of such delegates as would come, or whether we should wait and endeavour to get New South Wales to act with us. In order to make sure of what seemed highly probable, correspondence was opened with several eminent men in New South Wales I communicated with Sir James Martin, Mr Forster, Mr. Robertson, Mr. Parkes, Dr. Lang, Mr. Dailey, and other leading men, and found that all, with one single exception, were favourable to federation. Under those circumstances, it was thought that the time was not very distant when the co-operation of New South Wales would be obtained, and it was agreed not to hold any conference until her assent was procured. The friends of federation -in the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales at last obtained the appointment of a select committee, which deliberated on the question at some length, but never made any report. The committee of this House was revived in 1860, and again in 1862, but never -succeeded in getting the assent of New South Wales. So the matter rested. In fact, there was no manifest urgency for pushing it forward. 
It waited for circumstances to give it importance. Those circumstances, I think, have come; and, if we take up this question anew, I trust it will be with the resolute determination of carrying it through with whatever assistance we can get, without waiting for a preliminary unanimity.  Now, sir, I have barely glanced at the intercolonial effects of the creation of a federation. In the first place it would put an end to what a Canadian statesman describes as "colonies cutting each others throats with razors called tariffs." It would create between us an intercourse of mind. At present we scarcely know what is happening beyond our own borders; we know most imperfectly who are the men of intellect and action bond Cape Howe and the Murray. It would result in the creation of a national spirit - that spirit which has inspired some of the greatest actions in history. And, finally, it would give Australia complete control of her own resources for the protection of her own interests. I am persuaded that gold has not lost any of its old attractions the greed with which the buccaneer of olden days longed for one of the South American settlements, or for a ship from Mexico loaded with ingots, is something like the longing which would possess a French or a Yankee privateer to overhaul an Australian clipper on her homeward voyage, or make acquaintance with the ill-defended capital of a gold country. If federation involves us in some trouble or cost, one month of a war for which we were ill-prepared would cost us more. Therefore, on one point, I hope there will be absolute unanimity - that, if the country is compelled to resist foreign agression, we shall have available for the purpose the whole force of Australia.
