 be careful to keep the bowels open, eat wheaten bread and as much fruit as possible. Do not drink much tea or coffee. A little new milk with hot water in it will be a good substitute. I don't think oatmeal or wheaten meal porridge would do you any harm. It is easily digested and keeps the bowels open. 
Speaking of myself I have given up drinking coffee altogether and only drink one cup of tea in the day sometimes only half a cup of tea. I eat a plate of porridge every morning except Sunday when it is not made in the hotel. I usually take a light tea and do not eat later than half past six o'clock in the evening.  Late suppers are not good for either man or woman. Do not wear tight stays. Suspend the skirts and petticoats from bands over the shoulders - if possible - instead of buttoning them tight round the waist.
