It is not all prosperity a squatter's life in Australia, any more than in any business elsewhere, and there is far more trouble and anxiety than in almost any other business I know, but such as it is we must bear it. I am labouring under a considerable difficulty in writing having sore eyes. They have been very bad for over a week, so bad that I cannot bear a candle in the hut after sundown and can do nothing but lie on my rug and think or practise on my flute and make all kinds of hideous noises but that does not matter much as there is no one to hear and be annoyed at them. 
I had rather a serious encounter with 13 natives the other night I had my left arm rendered useless for days and my left knee badly hurt. It has swollen up considerably and gives me a good deal of pain, besides sundry odd knocks on the back and head. I had to fire 6 shots at them wounding some severely and then I had to fight them with my revolver which I had by the barrel and knocked two down with it when it broke although a strong Colt. I would have been finished I think outright had not my native boy, hearing the firing, come galloping up shouting as he came and the others I suppose thought help was coming and cleared off. It was all I could do to keep in the saddle riding home but I am getting all right again. I have sent a report of it to the Colonial Secretary and the Governor demanding police protection  The natives sent in word with one of my shepherds, first spearing him, to say that they would come down altogether and kill all the white men on the place. It may be only an idle threat but I have given out all the revolvers and guns I have to the men, and told them in case of an attack if possible to come into the station and tell me, and I will go and meet them. I have two or three rifles that none of the men can use and with them in daylight I consider myself a match for thirty or more niggers. If they do attack us I'll teach them a lesson once for all that they will remember to the end of their days.
