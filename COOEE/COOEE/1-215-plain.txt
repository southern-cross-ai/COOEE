Dear Cousin
I shall endeavour by the length of this Letter to pay up my arrears being at present in debt for your favours of the 28th Decem. 21 and 28th Feby 22. accompanying the latter I received 8 Numbers of the Edin. Revue... free from the hands of Mr Browne for which receive my acknowledgements, to have them second hand as you observe will serve my purpose quite as well as at the full price. indeed much better / though not myself of a very thrifty saving turn I can admire a judicious economy whether displayed in trifleing or momentary affairs I shall aim at following the practical example of so good a Standard, / it pleased me to find that you believed me to be above the weak vanity which would much rather pay for the whole Feast than another should have the first taste / with respect to the merit of the Edin. Review I agree with you, and think that it exceld every other work of the Kind in Europe which led me to make choice of it in my first letter to you however I beg it to be understood that my judgement is confined to Britain being pretty well read in most of her best Authors. France may or may not have a production of equal merit. ignorance on this head compels me to shut my mouth and of course to suppress the opinion,
I learn that France is a Nation deeply learned and far advanced in literature consequently it behoves one to be cautious in speaking upon the merits of our own Authors lest we are supposed from National prejudice to overlook or not duly appreciate the labours of any other individuals whether French, Italian or Turk.  
The character of Mr Jeffry I have been acquainted with some time, of his powerful talents I am a great admirer, and cannot say that I dislike his politicks 
Were you to ask me my reasons for this preference perhaps the answer would be common place and unsatisfactory; some men range themselves at once on the side of the weaker party without giving the merits of the quarrel any consideration, perhaps this is my case - and perhaps you will think me an egoist for saying so. I have observed the Wig faction possess in a much greater proportion men of real talent who by dint of ability only are enabled to keep anything like a footing against the all powerful influence of Tories and Placemen. many of these it has struck me crouch under the Arm of power from a conviction of what would be their comparative insignificance were they to join the Party among whom to be in any wise distinguished. Common sence is a great requisate / if what I have said should clash with your ideas tell me so and I will endeavour to convince myself of my error and get rid of my present prepossession in favour of a set of men whom I have principally known through the medium of Newspapers. perhaps calculated to convey but a very limited Knowledge of their true motives and principals. I am frequently told that an examination for a short time of men and manners in England would change my sentiments upon many subjects. this, I cannot believe notwithstanding Goldsmith himself tells us
"That life is a Book of which he whose observations have been confined to his own Native Country has only read a single page"
I trust however that I should at all times be open to conversion.
Should I want Books at any time I will avail myself of your obliging offer to send them out to me but we obtain them here almost with as great facility as in England, by giving a discretional order. / you might send some that I have already, my collection now being pretty good. The works of your ingenious Countryman Sir W. Scott I have long since read / scarcely one of His Poems or Novels have escaped me from the Lady of the Lake to the very inferior production upon Waterloo from Waverly to the Buccaneers / this last disappointed my expectations / whether it or the Monastery is best I cannot determine, and perhaps it will become me better to withold an opinion, lest a remark which I have some where read should be applied to me
"That every Man especially at an age when most... of experience and apprehension of being mistaken should put him upon his guard ought to be very cautious how he passed judgement upon Writers of established merit for fear it should happen to him as it does to a great many to blame what he does not understand."  If I thought Henry Grey Bonner could turn your extract from my Letter to our advantage I would surprise him with something more of the same kind from myself, but I doubt it. That same Right Honble Gent you must know has had the misfortune (tho a Wig) to fall a little under my displeasure for his very unwarranted attack upon Genl. McQuarie our late worthy Governor than whom a more strictly upright and Moral Man will never again rule over us, nor one who will show himself more truly alive to the best interests of the Colony by his laborious assiduity for its advancement and reformation / I am much astonished to find that the Revd. Mr Marsden has found means to create so general and so strong a feeling in his favour throughout Britain, and at the expence of the worthy Personage abovementioned, we here can best judge which of the two deserves it most. The great host of Religionists headed by the great Wilberforce seem to have long sought the ruin of a meritorious Man, acting unwittingly upon the most exaggerated and unfounded complaints; in the Country however the Revd. Gentn. alluded to stands alone, his spiritual Brethren on their arrival here invariably change sentiments towards him. 
The Commissioners Report I find is at last come forth, a few copies are now in the Colony, but I have not yet seen one. McQuarie as we expected is severely lashed and Marsden much excelled.. it is now almost the sole topic of the Day, nothing I believe ever excited a stronger sensation here, which is increased by the Copies being so scarce and the utter impossibility at present of getting them out of the hands of the few individuals to whom they are sent. everyone therefore is enquiring of his Neighbour if he has seen the Report or heard anything that is in it. Should this chance to be the case whatever it may be it is swallowed with the greater avidity. Should I be lucky enough to get it into my hands before the Vessel sails by which this Letter is forwarded I will let you know what will be the effect that in my opinion it is likely to produce in the event of the British Govt. adopting the Measures it may recommend though from what I can collect a total silence is observed upon the score at present that everything respecting the future direction of our affairs will be treated of in a continuation, a great many individuals well known here are rather roughly handled and some deservedly, but if all I hear is true, a great portion is irrelevant abuse, foreign to the purpose of his mission, and in no way calculated to further its ends while I admit that it was his particular province to make a faithful representation of the public Actions of public Men I think it made no part of his duty to animadvert upon the private conduct of private Men, deserve it or not, supposing however that he had the right to do so, its impolicy is obvious. indelible disgrace is fixed upon them, which does not perish... but is handed down to their Posterity - and if in this place, the Sins of the Fathers are to be visited upon the Children every scheme for reformation will be thwarted - every laudable excursion paralysed - if an enquiry was instituted into the Character of every man in the British Dominions, very few among those whom the World designate just and honourable if weighted in the balance but would be found wanting and without any real claim to such distinction. We know that the man does not breathe who can take a retrospect of his past life with guiltless satisfaction,- Should not some attention be paid to the way in which a Person sent here has conducted himself since he committed the offence that made him for a time an outcast, if it has been exemplary will any feeling liberal minded man say he ought not be reinstated in Society? - No to what end?. and then are these wounds so sensibly felt by him, and healed by good behaviour, again torn open, and he once more to answer as it were for crimes which by being harrowed up after the lapse of so many years places him in the same degraded point of view in which he stood as a culpret answering for them at the Bar of justice - Perhaps you will think the above stricture premature as I have not yet read the Report but those that have say that it contains a great deal of abstract matter and a very few palpably erronious statements. if so they will not fail in appearing before the British Public in a proper shape. two of the principal personages attacked are now in England, Messrs Redfern and Eagar. men possessed of good abilities and great local Knowledge, therefore quite competent to cope with Mr Bigge.  
in fact one of the objects of their voyage was to meet that Gentn. upon his own Ground, and reply to the aspertions they knew he was about to cast upon them. both it is true unfortunately came Prisoners to this Country, but have maintained an unimpeachable character ever since their arrival - which together with their superior talents have procured them much influence and esteem among those who came here under the same circumstances. they have consequently been looked upon as the Leaders of this party between which and a certain set here, a violent enmity and jealousy exists - these latter pride themselves upon having come out free but not content with conscious superiority which this circumstance assuredly gives them they catch at every opportunity to evince their contempt and dislike by the most arrogant demeanour and unfeeling expressions, the real cause is a jealousy of the increasing importance which the superior wealth of this class of the community is daily giving to them no hesitation is made in saying that a fellow who has been a convict should not be allowed to hold property and they would fain make it appear that in virtue of their condescension in coming among such vile refuse - the distance, too, considered - all the Loaves and Fishes should be wrested from the creatures and given as a compensation for the honour done the place by their presence. this feeling was carried so far as to be broached in one of our Courts of Justice the Judge of which is a person I have mentioned, / He took great pains to search for and examine musty old statutes and succeeded in finding one which provided that no subject once convicted of a Felony shall at any after time be allowed to possess Property in his own right / this has never been acted upon here, but was delivered with great emphasis to a crowed court as the Law of the Land. The great proportion of the people are here for Offences do not come within this statute - therefore the sensation excited by such a declaration was not very great, however upon being more maturely considered it was received as a dangerous point gained that might lead to something more comprehensive - the whole body of what are termed the Emancipists took the alarm, called a general Meeting and came to the resolution of appealing to the British Parliament. In pursuance of which Messrs Redfern and Eagar were deputed to lay their representations before the House of Commons, to enable them to meet every expence in doing so - they were furnished with about £1,000 Subscribed by the Meeting - though if it is true that the Commissioner himself recommends that the abovementioned Law which places the Effects of the Emancipated Felons in jeopardy should be abolished, all further proceeding on the part of Mr Eagar will be unnecessary. Should it ultimately turn out that we have formed an erroneous estimate of the value of Mr Bigg's mission to the Colony, I opine that you will set us down as a narrow-minded - prejudiced set - if you are not heavily sick, tired, and impatient of the tedious length of my treatise upon colonial politicks you will read on and hear the excuse I should make in such a case. but if on the contrary it is as uninteresting as I suspect and poor patience being worn to a skeleton, expires here the luckless Australians! what conclusions will be drawn to your disadvantage by my sober calculating headed Cousin. How is it he will say that these opinions are so widely diffused - upon what have these frail mortals at the Antipodes founded such notions and formed such gloomy anticipations when things it appears have turned out so diametrically opposite - they do not consult the Entrails of Beasts or the flight of Birds as in days of yore neither can I attribute it to the climate which is not of a nature to produce that vapourish disposition to view always the dark side of things - what is it then he will say to himself. Why nothing short of downright Rank prejudice - and I will prove it, - out of the mouth of one of their own body will I convict them, who forsooth has had the effrontery to say in one part of this letter that he has become prejudiced in favour of a set of men here without being able to assign any thing like a reasonable reason why - what therefore is this person's predominant passion? it does not require an answer - consequently as I believe him to be a fair specimen I conclude that they have all been activated by the same feeling in their speculations upon the results of Mr Bigg's Report and not worthy of a sensible Man's further notice. - But stop - it has just occurred to me that I have said in one of my Letters. That I take great interest in the affairs of this Country to give them up too precipitately will not seem so and upon second thoughts. I had better first read a little more of this tiresome letter.  
When I tell you that the Commissioner immediately on his arrival attached himself closely to the party I have spoken of as so hostile to the interests of the Emancipated Colonists and was evidently both in word and deed thoroughly infected with their illiberality you will think with me that they had great cause to apprehend the words from him. My good Cousin resumes - well this is a tolerable apology and may do, but had they been anything better than short sighted dolts without one particle of penetration they would have at once seen the refined policy of Mr B's conduct in adopting the best method of drawing out all these real sentiments by a deceiving sympthay This my dear Cousin was a motive I at one time was willing to attribute to him, it doubtless would have been wise plan had there been a sincere desire on the part of Mr Biggs to secure  the interests of one part of the community against the power and malignity of the others, but the nicest resolver of doubtful cases would view this in the light only of a possibility and to be rejected in favour of a conclusion drawn from Word and deed. Notwithstanding however all that has been said and done, the words of the people are satisfied that whatever may be the ulterior purposes of God  with regard to New South Wales it will continue to preserve its character for justice and moderation, should we unfortunately be mistaken, other sentiments than those of loyalty and attachment to the Mother Country will develope  themselves as time advances; the Native born's of even the first generation are not so void of reflection or common sence as not to value themselves upon personal freedom and equal system of laws: before I conclude this subject I cannot refrain from once more recommending the character of the Govr. Macquarie to your notice. I am anxious to impress upon your mind a thorough persuasion of his worth - it would give me much pleasure if my humble efforts should be any wise instrumental in doing, justice to a man whose most heartfelt pleasure during his arduous administration here was to promote the welfare of such as manifested a return of virtuous  feelings and good conduct what can be a nobler undertaking than to  snatch a poor lost fellow creature from the vortex of Sin and misery - to restore a useful agent to society by those well directed means which had Govr. McQuarie been weak or vile enough to give up in favour of the opinions of the Set here who are shameless enough to contend that for Convicts this is a place of punishment exclusively, and that for example sake no other consideration should influence the conduct of the Govt towards them, had this injudiceous system I say been pursued, those that now form the most important and valuable part of the population of New South Wales would have been languishing in Slavery and wretchedness, not the protectors but the disturbers of Society: does he then whose disinterested benevolence has made so many of his fellow-men happy desire to be thought and spoken of with horror (as is the case in Scotland) as the determined opponent of all good works - the merciless persecutor of that paragon of holiness Saint Samuel, were the good people of your Country, those I mean who deem themselves specially called upon to execrate the name of the tyrant, and foe of religion, but whose zeal I am afraid hurry them to judgement upon ex-parte evidence were they coolly to examine should an opportunity offer, the portly carcase - round fat jolly red face and laughing eyes of the said Saint of ours whom I have no doubt they have been accustomed to view in imagination as the very type of mortification and woe with the pale emaciated visage thin spare form and dozen sorrowful etceteras, the usual consequence of deep care, me thinks it would strike them that the appearance of the Man indicated very little suffering either in mind or body, which together with the testimony of every old inhabitant in the place ought to be proof sufficient to refute the unfavourable opinions entertained of Genl. Macquarie respecting his conduct to Mr Marsden - you may judge for yourself of the degree of estimation this worthy man is held in when I tell you that on his ensuing Birthday there are to be no less than four Public Dinners in the single Town of Sydney - If Mr Wilberforce was aware that instead of those mighty things atchieved among the Savages of New Zealand by Mr Marsden there is comparatively nothing done for the advancement of Religion and civilisation, and that through mismanagement and the bad Conduct of the Missionaries the Natives have taken a disgust at the former which many years will not efface, his present opinion of Mr M might be a little staggered. 
you will scarcely credit what profligacy that some of these Ministers have attained, it is a fact that one of them keeps several of the Native Women under the very eyes of his Wife. Some credit would have been due to Mr Marsden if he had turned his attention in the spiritual way to our own Aboriginees but it unluckily happens that these poor wretches have neither Pork nor Flax to give for the saving of their Souls; when our native institution was suggested by Govr. Macquarie Mr Marsden could not be prevailed upon to give his assistance or countenance to it upon what principle I could never learn, but it is thought that he was chagrined that any but himself should have been the first promoter or that his opinion of their intellects was so contempable  that he despaired of ever being able to bring them to the Knowledge of a God, the result has provd  that such a surmise would have been fallacious for under proper treatment these truly benighted race have manifested a degree of intelligence which I thought was not in their nature, they are notwithstanding the lowest species of human beings, and consequently it is an arduous task to undertake to draw such from a state of barbarism and adapt them to the purposes of Society - That they have degenerated from a state of nature is clear from a comparison with other newly discovered people by the most wimsical casuist it cannot be contended that nature who has bestowed such various faculties on man should originally have designed these for so abject a condition, Inured to privation of almost every kind they find in ease apparently their only comfort, From habitual indolence they have become supine and slothful, their ideas extending no further than the objects within their view, and from thence it follows that their language must be very confined as it can embrace little more than the names of places and the Animal and Vegetable productions of the climate, In their infancy they must be treated tenderly, in order that as they grow up they may look back with aversion to their primitive condition and feel the more sensibly their obligation to providence and to us as its immediate instruments in releasing them from a state of misery and want. They should feel as we do that to the continuance of the comforts they enjoy something must be necessary, as nothing can be obtained without an endeavour to procure it. These endeavours closely connected constitute a life of industry to the measure of which a short experience would acquaint them those enjoyments would be proportioned and industry arising from necessity would be as acceptable to them as to any of the people.  
The emigration to our shores is just now very great, every vessel lands a swarm, no less than seventy (70) persons came out upon one Ship a short time since. as these seemed with scarcely an exception respectable I went on board for the purpose of examining how suitable accomodations could possibly be provided for so many in so small a Ship and upon viewing the small comfortless holes I then met with did not before believe that Men would tolerate an existance in such a place though ever so eager to come out here and partake of the Milk and Honey which the sanguine minds of many together with the high coloured representation of Mr Jeffrys and others leads them to believe flows without end. Ours is undoubtedly a fine Country, both as to Soil and Climate, but nothing extraordinary nor worthy of the extravagant praise that has been bestowed upon it by such enthusiasts as Mr J, the best guide for a Settler to go by that I have yet seen (excepting the valuable Worth ) of my Countryman Wentworth  is a small publication written by a Captain Dixon the commander of a ship called the Skelton that was out here about 2 years ago. it has no pretensions to literary worth, but is a simple and unvarnished relation of facts. it represents as far as the truth will warrant the advantages resulting from Emigration to N.S.W. without concealing any of the difficulties that present themselves to the surprise and disappointment of most Settlers, several have returned in disgust but these I am happy to say are such as we shall never have to regret the losing of - indeed we have had many character imported of late years whose absence could have been borne without any serious injury to the interests of the Country, who like sickly stagnant waters taint the atmosphere without fertilizing the Soil /  They journey this far you would suppose for the sole and generous purpose of showing the latest fashions and most approved Airs and attitudes, with no small share of self respect and importance they walk and strut a very little more than an hour upon our stage before they are hurled back to their native insignificance, a short experience shows that something more than a well made coat and imposing manner is necessary to persuade us they are genuine Gentlemen; a disappointment in this respect frequently operates in depriving our Society of those honourable members. and by the bye in several instances lately in such a way as left no choice to the parties for you must know some of our most immaculate Settlers have been in a very rude manner shipped off with some disaggreable appendages to the legs called Irons to the Settlements of New Castle and Port Macquarie places appropriated for the reception of Malefactors from this place, it is I believe a reasoned maxim that an Ass can wear a Lion's skin for a season only, the moral is applicable to these Gentlemen, there is something that we call behaviour that is amediately and uniformly understood The plainest peasant or labourer will say of a man whom he esteems in a certain way, He is a Gentleman every bit of him, and he is perfectly understood by all who hear him not rank in life but a turn of mind a tenor of conduct that is amiable and worthy and the ground of confidence. Formerly it was very common for Settlers to remain here only a sufficient length of time to get their land measured - to take up the Grant - and then to steal away having first taken care to pocket a little cash the proceeds of the Farm which was amediately  Sold to one of the Residents. this very fraudulent practice has been effectivally remedied by some late Order regulating the distribution of Land, and which will have the judicious tendency of proportioning the Grant to the Capital. heretofore recommendatory letters to Men in power have in a very many instances been suffered to have an undue influence, that a poor Emigrant possessed of these have succeeded in obtaining larger Grants than the real Capitalist  who had the means of carrying into effect every thing required of him by the Govt. and added a real benefit to the Colony by the introduction of his property, the present system requires the Emigrant for every Hundred Acres located to him to support a Man from his own means permanently. consequently for 1,000 Acres he must take ten men. I hear such an incumbrance as this will require no mean Capital which consideration will induce every one who is not imprudent enough to risk the loss of his all to take no more than upon a calculation he will find he can safely support, some have indeed laid the foundation of their inevitable ruin by departure from this line of conduct among whom is your friend Browne, if he really is such by the way I must in confidence tell you I never could suffer this Gent. to bear the same relation to me not that I know any thing of him inconsistant with the character of an honest man, but there is something so disgustingly obtrusive and unrefined in his nature with which the longer is your acquaintance the less you feel disposed to that `Sweet communion of Souls' which characterizes true friendship and esteem; if he did not quarrel with every Passenger coming out his manner and disposition bred such a dislike of him, that all with scarcely an exception keep him at the greatest distance /  if Mr Miller came by the same Vessel I think a very worthy young man Mr Thomson and he are distantly related from standing in the same degree of affinity to a Mr Young who gave them both Letters to Sir Thomas Brisbane, but I am sorry to say very little notice has been taken of either one or the others. Mr T indeed from having a little personal Knowledge of his Excely. recd. the most attention but these consisted in empty professions and unperformed promises. the truth is that his Philosophical speculations ocupy so much time that little can be spared for friend or the duties of his Govt. which I am grieved to say are most shamefully neglected, instead of the affairs of the Colony being in that flourishing and rapidly improving state which characterized the active administration of Govr. Macquarie. they have been cramped and almost ruined by a series of injurious measures, a want of energy and a total disregard for the interests of the Country in the present Rulers, This is a sweeping charge you will say but I assure you it is not the less true. 
I have written so much this time otherwise would enter more into particulars upon this subject, however will not fail to do so some time or other suffice it to say that Sir Thomas either from supineness of reluctance to abstract himself in the least from more momentous affairs  upper regions has thrown ours entirely into the hands of Mr Gouldbourn the Colonial Secty. (a mere understrapper from Downing Street) a person who has neither ability or inclination to do us good. Mr Thomson is now at Port Dalrymple V.D.L. waiting patiently for the appointment of Naval Officer to that place which I believe is to take place shortly, upwards of 12 Months have elapsed since he had the first promise of it from Sir Thomas who led him to expect that immediately on his arrival at Port Da. the Situation would be given to him in consequence of which Mr T. set off for that place forthwith where to his great surprise and disappointment he learnt from Lieut. Govr. Sorrell that the appointment was about to be confirmed to Lieut. Kenworthy who was then doing the duty, this person held another situation at the same time equally as good which is inconsistant with our Colonial laws when vested in the same person permanently, the propriety of a division therefore suggested itself and Mr T. was in hope either one or the other would be given to him by an order from head quarters as soon as an explanation had taken place with Sir Thomas. but he was disappointed, and after a vexatious and expensive delay of several months returned in despair to this place accompanyed by Mrs T. and infant Daughter. Our Mother who was then on a visit to the part of the family  residing at Port Dalrymple - advised him to this step and came back the same time.  As soon as Captain Wood who lives on the Hobart Town side of the Country heard of the departure of Mr T. he waited upon Lieut. Govr. Sorrell and expostulated with him upon the treatment Mr T. had recd.. the Govr. then told him that if Mr Thomson would return he would in a short time arrange it for Mr T. to have the Naval Officership and Kenworthy the other for a permanency instead - Captn. Wood amediately  wrote to Mr T. strongly advising him to try his luck once more in Van Diemens, he has done so, however before his departure he had an interview with the Govr. in Chief who furnished him with another letter to Sorrell desiring that he might have the appointment, which by the next arrival we are in hopes to hear has taken place. In about three Weeks I myself leave this (Sydney) for Port Dalrymple having under my protection Mrs Thomson who was left here with us until Mr T. was certain he was not again deceived. indeed it behoves one to provide well against the bad faith of the present Govr. Sir Thomas had power without doing injustice to any one to appoint Mr Thomson at once and have saved the delay and anxiety which he occasioned him by his undecisive letters which were couched in such a style as to leave it almost optional with Sorrell whether he noticed them or not.
My principal business at Port Dalrimple  is to take possession of Fourteen Hundred Acres of Land which Sir Thomas has given me upon the present system of a Man to each 100 acres, I shall return to Sydney in about four Months unless my Elder Brothers advise me to remain and turn Farmer, but I do not Know how I should at present be able to reconcile myself to such a life, my desire is first to make a voyage to Europe and see something of the World, but to accomplish this requires better friends than my own individual Self is in possession of, and to go solely depending upon our good Mother is an incumbrance I never could think of loading her with. Oftentimes I have wished that His Majesty had me for one of his Military Servants and a more Zealous and loyal one perhaps he may not have though a far distant Australation , how unlucky it is that the said illustrious personage is not fully aware of the great acquisition I should be to his interests, Why in imagination alone I have in the field atchieved  the most wondrous deeds, if therefore they wish them done in reallity  give me but a Commission and an oppertunity and then If it was my fortune to posess a friend in some very great Man (as for instance Dr Chalmers) I should apply to him forthwith to use his interest in obtaining for me what at present is my greatest ambition a Commission in the Army Stationed though almost any where but here, this you know would be my passport in all climes as a Gent and would put me in possession of the means tho  at first moderate of obtaining Wisdom I mean that since Knowledge of the World which I have laboured hard to gain through the medium of Books, in this Country the means of enlarging the mind by observation and intercourse with your fellows is very confined especially as jealosies and party feeling runs so high moreover the great bulk of our Society is composed of Adventurers and others whose main object is the bettering of their condition.  The conversation therefore seldom runs upon any topic save what may amediately concern the speaker and such as no one whose mind is bent upon any thing but money making would feel any interest in. My Brother James has entered into Copartnership with our elder Brother Thomas and gone to reside at Port Dalrymple, this is indeed rather an inconsiderable place compared with Hobart Town and not by any means so flourishing, but the competion had of late become so great at the latter settlement, in consequence of the amazing influx of Settlers, as to produce a very sensible effect upon the profits of James business, and as an improvement was not likely to take place, Thomas and he wisely agreed to unite their Capital and carry on business at Port Dal. where they comparatively would have little opposition as their joint means would enable them to command the Market; at this place too all their landed property Cattle and Sheep lie. They purpose blending Commerce with Agriculture, the latter to be conducted by Thomas and the former by James, thrive they must, both are too prudent to enter into any wild Speculation, neither is encumbered with debt, and their property in land and Stock is now very considerable. of the former they possess upward of 3,000 Acres without the burden which as I have before stated is urged by the present system, of Horned Cattle they have nearly 500 Head and of Sheep about 2,000 - all of which is exclusive of their Stock in Trade, House, &c -
Of the Marriage of our Sister Eliza I need not speak, by the bye if we guessed right you were desirous that a great part of the World should be made acquainted with such an occurance as we have seen it in many of the Scotch and English papers which we concluded got in through no other channel than yours, if this is the case you will observe that you made a mistake in saying that Mr Thomson came out as one of the Suit of Sir Thomas Brisbane.  
Before you are no doubt made acquainted with the Marriage of our Sister Celia to Mr Thomas Wills of whom I believe you had previously heard a little, such an event was to me a gratifying circumstance as from our infancy him and I have been on terms of the strictest intimacy and friendship. our tempers and dispositions are heretofore well known to each other, and I will venture to say very few in the World possess characters more amiable and honourable than his in every respect, add to this a handsome person and gentlemany manners, but these you will say are secondary considerations, true with the moralist, but not the ladies, and I have my suspicions that they had no small weight with my good Sister long before She visited your Shores, You see, I have pestered you a good deal with our family affairs but your very kind attention to our Mother and Sisters, the very high terms in which they at all times speak of you, as well as your evident interest in our family matters we regard you as a member of it more nearly allied to us than our real tie of consanguinity warrants. henceforth I shall consider you as a brother and as a consequent to this title endowed with all the privileges thereto appertaining which I take to consist in the right of giving wholesome advice and admonition intermixed when necessary with a proper share of censure - an unreserved development of opinions and sentiments, which I trust will at all times be mutual.
By the Minerva I send you Sydney Gazettes from the First Nov. to the Sixth of February 23 also an allmanack for the present year, I would have sent according to you desire the Australian Magazine had I thought it worth your notice. according to your request I addressed the Parcel cont. the Newspapers and Almanack to the care of Charles Corran, & Co. Leith
I have written to your Brother Mr John Hope but have not yet received any answer, If I was sure Wm. could spare the time taken up in answering a letter (but which I conclude his Elder Br. had not at disposal) I would drop him a few lines upon the state of Religion here.
I believe I have nothing more to say in this letter in my next I shall touch fully upon the present Govt.
In conclusion I have Dear Sir to assure you of the affection & esteem of Geo. Reibey
I will trouble you with one small Commission - it is to send me out McKenzies treatise upon "Phrenology."
