First of all, I would say to the hon. member, Dr. Cockburn, that our mission is to frame an adequate scheme for federation.
Dr. COCKBURN: 
Not for unification!
Mr. MUNRO: 
Just to all the colonies!
Mr. DEAKIN: 
The hon. member, I take it, was not entitled to interpret that phrase in the strict and narrow manner which he has attempted. Speaking for myself, what I, at all events, took as the meaning of the mandate, was that while the Australasian colonies recognised that they had not yet reached-and probably never will reach-a condition in which  they desired absolute amalgamation, they had reached a condition in which they desired a closer union than has hitherto obtained. The hon. member, admitting so much, contends that this closer union was never on any subject, at any time, or in any manner, to sink what may be termed the individuality of the states; whereas the contention I would maintain would be, that while the colonies declared most distinctly and with an emphatic voice, which has found its echo in the first resolution moved by the hon. member, Sir Henry Parkes, that they would not part with their powers of local self-government on all matters with which local self-government was competent to deal. But they were prepared to part with their powers in rotation to certain subjects on which they believed that the interests of each were the interests of all, and that the interests of all were the interests of each. They believed that on certain special subjects there were no longer two interests-that there were no longer state interests, but only national interests. They believed that on those special subjects it would be possible to safeguard all state interests, and to commit to a new parliament, to be entitled the federal parliament, the power of dealing with particular subjects within certain lines, as the people were in reality on those subjects one people with one destiny and one interest. The argument which I have endeavoured to maintain from the beginning of this debate has been that, while there are certain state rights to be guarded, most of those rights, if not all of them, can be guarded by the division of powers between the central government and the local governments. The states will retain full powers over the greater part of the domain in which they at present enjoy those powers, and will retain them intact for all time. But in national issues, on the subject of defence, as people who desire to have their shores defended, and to see their resources developed by means of a customs tariff and a customs union - on these questions there are no longer state rights and state interests to be guarded in the constitution, but the people's interests are one, and they call upon us to deal with them as one. Do we need to repeat the commonplaces of every federation speech at every federation gathering, and every festive gathering, for many years, which remind us that we are one people, living under similar forms of government, that we speak the same language, and that we have the same general interests, bearing sway quite as much in one part of Australia as in another? Are we to say that while we are here for union, and to declare for union, we shall never have more union than can be obtained by the maintenance of our separate state rights in every particular; so that it shall not be possible for the union to deal with any question, except by means of the states, and through the states of which that union is composed? By the resolution, that is not intended. Is it to be contended that union upon these particular subjects, within this narrow field, as it may be termed when compared with the broad field of general legislation, is not to be consummated, and that we are here to draw up proposals for a constitution which shall not only retain the state rights, but retain them in an absolute supremacy? We may feel perfectly certain from the outset that such preservation of conflicting authorities cannot work satisfactorily to the people of the country. Are we now, in the very inception of our undertaking, to endeavour to create on the one side an irresistible force, and on the other side an immovable object? Are we to place within the popular house, with all the authority which attaches to those who directly represent the people, responsible ministers, who are to hold their seats only so long as they can justify their actions to that chamber?
 
Mr. PLAYFORD: 
The hon. member, Sir John Downer, does not propose that!
Mr. BAKER: 
You are assuming that we are going to have responsible government!
Mr. DEAKIN: 
The request of the hon. member, Mr. Munro, that these questions should be settled first, so that we might approach the proposal of the hon. member, Mr. Wrixon-knowing exactly what the senate was to be, and what the form of government was to be-was refused; and although I admit that it is not settled yet, I am prepared to argue as if these contingencies were admitted, because they are at least most probable. The resolutions of the hon. member, Sir Henry Parkes, propose to adopt responsible government; and it is natural to assume, for the purposes of argument, that they will be accepted until they have been rejected. Therefore, if we are to create a house, with all the traditions, so far as responsible government and its authority is concerned, of the representative chambers which exist in those colonies and the mother country, and are then to introduce on the other side, clothed with equal power, a body entirely foreign to the British Constitution, and to which there is no sufficient parallel in the Australian colonies, we shall be creating at the outset certain conflict and inevitable deadlock.
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: 
Why?
Mr. DEAKIN: 
I will tell the hon. gentleman why. The popular chamber receives, or believes it receives, a mandate from the electors to carry a certain measure, which we will suppose affects finance; or it may be an ordinary measure, but we will take it to be a financial measure. It is carried in that chamber by a large majority; it is sent to the upper chamber, which, we will take it, for the purpose of argument, does not represent the people directly, however much it may represent them indirectly. The second chamber rejects the measure. The popular chamber, through its government, passes the measure for the second time, and the upper house rejects it a second time. The government advises his Excellency to dissolve the popular chamber, in order that they may appeal to their constituents. They appeal to their constituents; they come back with a renewed mandate, given perhaps with stronger voice than before, directing them to pass the measure. They cannot pass it. They can never pass it, because the senate may always stand in the way.
Mr. McMILLAN: 
How could that affect a money bill?
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: 
Or any other bill!
Mr. DEAKIN: 
They come back with a stronger mandate than ever from the country to carry the proposal into law, and the second house rejects it again and again.
Mr. CUTHBERT: 
But would they do that?
Mr. DEAKIN: 
Well, if you will make a provision to the effect that they shall not be able to do it, if hon. members will propose a means by which we shall see an issue to the conflict, we shall be proceeding on proper lines, and we shall have something to assist us. But as the resolution at present stands we are to create a second chamber which may defy, for all time, the will of the people of the country.
Mr. CLARK: 
Nobody wants that!
Mr. DEAKIN: 
I hope nobody does want it.
Mr. BARTON: 
Cannot you make your check apply to all bills as well as money bills?
An HON. MEMBER: 
A body without any power!
Mr. DEAKIN: 
Hon. members are surely guilty of a fault which they would be only too ready to attribute to myself, when I say that this interjection is remarkably extreme. To say that the chamber which you are perfectly willing to endow  with the power of rejecting a measure, or, if it be anything but a monetary measure, of amending it at need, of negativing for some years the direct mandate of the popular chamber, and that you only require them to cease to oppose the popular will when that will has been definitely and deliberately declared,-if you say that is not endowing them with power, then I say there is not a representative chamber in the world which possesses any power. It is only in a chamber like that of the United States Senate of America, which stands so far above the reach of popular opinion expressed through the ordinary channels, that such a course of conduct is possible with out a revolution. And why is it possible? It is possible, because the executive in that case is separated from the legislature; because the executive is independent of the two chambers, and because the people look to the executive to carry out their will as far as administration is concerned. But in the constitution we are about to propose the executive will be mainly in the popular chamber of the legislature, and bound to obey the directions of that chamber. Therefore, you will have the popular chamber, guided by its government, and supported by the great majority of the people of this country, entering into a conflict with that house which you propose to make the guardian of state rights. I say that those who are taking this course, believing they are conserving state rights and conserving the union, are, to my mind, under a most serious misapprehension. I can conceive nothing more antagonistic to the continuance and maintenance of union than to set the bulk of the population, their representatives in Parliament, and their responsible government, in perpetual conflict with an upper house supposed to represent the states. I say that the equal representation which the states demand must be conceded to them, that the power which the states require for their own protection must also be conceded to them. What I contend is, that it is not necessary, in order to obtain the adequate protection of all state rights, in order to secure absolute justice to all the smaller colonies, to endow the upper house with the power to amend money bills, or to pronounce an absolute veto on all bills. There are numbers of gentleman present sufficiently experienced in constitutional government to be able to devise a means by which the wishes of the senate, as representing the states, should be given all the effect which can possibly be given to them, without bringing the constitution to disruption. It is perfectly possible to endow that chamber with the power of revision and review, to place them in such relation with their constituents that they may be in time of conflict sent back to them, whoever they may be, in order to receive from them a fresh and further direction. It may be possible to propose half a dozen schemes, with none of which I will at present delay the Committee. It ought to be possible to propose one which should be acceptable to all reasonable men, which should endow the senate, or states house, with all the powers with which a second chamber can be endowed, without bringing the progress of legislation absolutely to a standstill-that is to say, without rendering it, not only possible, but probable, that legislation will be brought to a standstill. My hon. co-delegates from Victoria have been accused of introducing into this chamber the party conflicts that have been waged in that colony; but we should have been false to our obligations, not only to our own colony, but also to this Convention, if we had not warned hon. members of the rocks upon which we have been nearly shipwrecked. What we say is that to endow an upper house with these exceptional privileges and powers, and to provide no means for a solution of their difficulties with the popular chamber, is to invite contention  and prolong deadlocks. We say at the same time that it should be possible to constitute an upper house so intimately in relation with public opinion and composed of men so highly qualified that it should exercise a very large and salutary power indeed in controlling legislation, and in controlling even the executive government. We say that all this is possible, and we admit that all this should be done; but what we do say is that this bald proposition of the hon. and learned member, Sir John Downer, commits us to the other extreme-to the absolute veto, to the equal control of money bills, which will lead to two-fold discussion of the estimates in the second chamber-which will lead to the discussion of the minutest points of the administration of the executive government in a chamber to which that government is only indirectly responsible. If you are about to make this change you should go further. You should either not make this change, which is out of harmony with our existing institutions, and cannot be brought into harmony with a constitution in which there is responsible government rooted in a popular chamber; but if you do take this step, you should at once, and boldly, adopt bodily those foreign constitutions to which you have gone for precedents. If you want the Swiss Constitution, take the Swiss Constitution; if you want the American Constitution, take the American Constitution; but do not attempt to mix them with the British Constitution.
Mr. BAKER: 
Why cannot we have an Australian constitution?
Mr. DEAKIN: 
I have not the slightest objection to having an Australian constitution; but an Australian constitution that was begun by 
setting aside the political experience of the civilised world would have a poor chance of doing any good. Any constitution that is built up must be built on the experience gained of other constitutions in other parts of the world.
Mr. BARTON: 
To what experience of federal constitutions is the hon. member appealing?
Mr. DEAKIN: 
I am appealing in the first instance to the fact that there are radical distinctions between the American Constitution and those of these colonies. The radical differences are, that in America the executive is separated from the legislature; that the two chambers and the executive work all three independently; that, although the whole three are often, if not at war, entirely at issue, there is provision for carrying on the government notwithstanding. There is no such provision in the constitution which is sketched here. Here your responsible government is to be made responsible to the representative chamber.
Mr. BAKER: 
We have not agreed to responsible government yet!
Mr. DEAKIN: 
It is in this sketch; and if hon. members depart from the sketch let them do so on rational grounds. If they are about to take a new constitution let them take one of which we have some experience, and not a hybrid-something from the Swiss, something from the British, and something from our own. They are taking irreconcilable elements that cannot be made to work in harmony. If hon. members desire to adopt the Swiss Constitution, let them adopt it. There they have no dissolution of the popular chamber, the government is elected from the two chambers, and the system forms a consistent whole. It may be worthy the consideration of the Convention whether we should or should not adopt that consistent whole. It may be worthy of consideration whether we should not adopt the American Constitution with perhaps a little amendment. But what I wish to say, in answer to the hon. and learned member, Mr. Barton, is that to introduce the American Senate into the British Constitution
Mr. BAKER: 
It is not proposed!  
Mr. DEAKIN: 
There would be an inevitable conflict. Either the responsible government and the popular chamber must rule, as in most English-speaking countries, or the senate of state nominees must rule, as the senate, in most respects, practically rules in the American republic. We should beware of combining irreconcilable elements, and should not seek to import into this British Constitution a portion of another constitution, and expect it to work smoothly. Our experience teaches us that the dangers which we have run in the past have arisen entirely from the fact that we have created upper houses that claimed more authority than was their due, and have endeavoured to exercise it. The propositions which my hon. colleague has submitted are not propositions which any hon. member can honestly say take away too much from the senate of this country.
HON. MEMBERS: 
Oh, oh!
Mr. DEAKIN: 
They propose that the senate shall have equal power with the house of representatives in respect of all bills, except money bills, so that in every other matter that comes before the senate it stands as well equipped for dealing with legislation as does the popular chamber. There should be a tribunal to which it would not be too difficult to appeal in case of differences between the two houses on those measures; but, allowing that to pass, my hon. colleague excepts from the control of the senate money bills, bills dealing with customs and excise, and the annual appropriation bill. He does not say these may not be rejected, but he says that they must not be amended; he believes that the second chamber should only exercise its power with regard to money bills in such extreme cases as those in which it will be prepared to reject the whole proposal put before it, but should not meddle with the financial affairs of the country by entering into the details of those proposals. The 2nd resolution says:
The act of union shall provide that it shall not be lawful to include in the annual appropriation bill any matter or thing other than the votes of supply for the ordinary service of the year.
What this means is that every money bill which may be a bill involving a question of policy shall come to the second chamber independently, and the second chamber shall, if it please, be entitled to reject that measure, to challenge the opinion of the country upon it, and to say that until the opinion of the country is pronounced, that measure shall not pass into law. Are not these large and sufficient powers?
Mr. ADYE DOUGLAS: 
No!
Mr. DEAKIN: 
If not, show us how we may broaden them without taking the perilous leap to the other side of the stream, proposed by the hon. and learned member, Sir John Downer. Surely there is some via media between the gift of these excessive powers and that of powers which should be sufficient, without making the senate equal with the house of representatives by clothing it with the same authority, although it has not the same mode of election, nor the same constituents at its back. Surely there is some via media to be found. Because we think the upper houses in our own states do not possess sufficient powers-that the new senate should possess more powers than the upper houses of our present states possess-and because we believe that state rights ought to be protected: surely we will not go to the other extreme, and say that the senates are to be all in all, and the majority of the population, no matter how great, is to be capable of being ignored on all questions of policy and the smallest detail on the annual estimates of the year.
Mr. BAKER: 
No one proposes such an absurdity!
Mr. DEAKIN: 
It could be done.  What we ask the hon. member, who says that it is all absurdity, is to join with us in drawing a constitution that shall prevent that absurdity. He cannot deny that the amendment proposed by the hon. and learned member, Sir John Downer, admits of the possibility-I say it admits of the probability, if not the certainty-of that absurdity. I believe we are all at one in the object we seek to gain, which is the efficient protection of state rights, and surely they can be efficiently protected without allowing the senate to enter into the consideration of every £10 which it may be proposed to spend on a post-office or every £5 increase of salary proposed to be given to a civil servant. Surely there are a number of questions which can be dealt with by the popular chamber without trenching on state rights. Will the hon. members who consider that these proposals of the hon. and learned member, Mr. Wrixon, do not give sufficient power to the second chamber join us in endeavouring to frame a constitution which shall give them sufficient, but not absolute power-which shall say, as the hon. member, Sir John Bray, said in his most carefully reasoned-out speech, that, "In the last resort, and after the fullest consideration and delay, the will of the majority must rule" I will they admit that cardinal principle?
Mr. BAKER: 
We have always admitted that!
Mr. DEAKIN: 
Well, if hon. members admit it, will they take care to provide for it, because it is indisputable on the face of it that the proposal of the hon. member, Sir John Downer, allows the minority to rule in everything, if they please. We all know that minorities, as well as majorities, will be composed of reasonable men, and that what I suggest is not likely to take place frequently; but it is not our province, as the hon. member, Mr. Gordon, said, to rely too much on good-feeling without other guarantees. We must draw a constitution that is fair upon the face of it, and to be fair on the face of it it must provide against any abuse of authority by a minority. If the hon. member, Sir John Downer, will join us in providing against the abuse of power by a minority I believe he will find every member of the Convention with him. Let him give the states all just power, but let him for once protect the nation. Let us not frame a scheme of government expressly designed to provide for the rule of the minority, instead of that of the majority. If we are all agreed on that principle we can soon arrive at an agreement; but in its present form it is certain that Sir John Downer's proposal goes too far. Let us see if we cannot find a means of protecting state rights, and the rights of the majority of the nation at the same time.
Mr. McMILLAN: 
I think most hon. members will agree with me that the atmosphere which has predominated here since the beginning, of our business has been an atmosphere of compromise-compromise, as long as we do not give up any vital principle. It seems to me that we ought, instead of getting into the absolute corner indicated by some members at the present time, to try and go, step by step, and see whether there is a possibility of agreeing, and whether, even if with our apparent disagreements upon principle, there may not be some machinery that can be adopted, say, in a select committee, which may practically bring about what members on both sides of the question require. I find a little ambiguity in the amendments of the hon. member, Mr. Wrixon. I should be willing to allow the first amendment to go to a select committee with one alteration. It reads: 
The senate shall have equal power with the house of representatives in respect to all bills, except money bills, bills dealing with duties of customs and excise, and the annual appropriation bill, and these it shall be entitled to reject but not to amend.  
I should be willing to leave out money bills, and make it read thus: The senate shall have equal power with the house of representatives in respect to all bills except bills dealing with duties of customs and excise.
Mr. DEAKIN: 
Leaving out the annual appropriation bill?
