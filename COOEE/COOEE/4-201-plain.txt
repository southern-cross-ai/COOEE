It is, nevertheless, their duty to assert that the causes leading to the strike cannot, in the remotest degree, be traced to any actions by the employers. The alleged incidents given as the reasons for the origin of the strike are two in number: - 1st, That the captain of an intercolonial steamer dismissed a fireman for reasons, to his mind, fully justified by the facts of the case. 2. That employers refused to discuss demands made by marine officers of intercolonial and coasting steamers, while under duress of those officers, being affiliated to labour unions. As to the first, it is alleged by the unions of labour that the fireman was dismissed for the reason that he was a delegate of his union. This is contrary to fact; his being the mouthpiece of or delegate from his union was merely a coincidence, and the captain would have been wanting in his duty to his owners had he not dismissed him. The fact of a man being a delegate does not raise him to a level higher than any other member of the crew, and it cannot be denied that to properly maintain discipline on board of a vessel, a captain has a right to dismiss any man whose presence on board is inimical to the discipline necessary to the safety of the ship.  As to the second, it will be admitted by all right-thinking, unbiassed persons that it would be impossible to maintain that discipline essential to safety of life and property if marine officers and men serving under them were allied by union. The marine officers were informed that the owners were prepared to meet their demands by substantial concessions, but with the condition that, placed as they were as representatives of the owners, any association by them in Union with the men serving under them could not be permitted, and their demands were rightly excluded from consideration by the owners until their officers dissolved their alliance with other unions. Having dealt particularly with the two alleged immediate causes for the strike, it is necessary to notice a cause contributing to it. In the rules of trades unions, it is sought, by stringent regulations, to secure a monopoly of work and to limit membership.  This is not only an injustice to the large amount of labour outside their ranks, but contributes to the undue interference by labour organisations with the trade of the colonies. The tactics adopted deserve severe condemnation. Foremost is the unjust combination of various unions to boycott trade so as to enforce the demands of the particular union concerned. The means adopted in combination are various and far-reaching in their character. Edicts are issued that the produce of these colonies, coal and other minerals, wool, wheat, and other products from the land must not be carried or shipped if at any period of its production or transit labour is employed outside the trade organisations. And as to the internal trade efforts are made to prevent supplies of the raw material to manufactories employing free labour, and, in the disposal of the manufactured article, every opposition is given to legitimate realisation. But, still more extraordinary, the necessaries of life are in some instances refused to those who withhold compliance with the demands of trades unions. Intimidation is practised by trades unionists. Free labourers are prevented by threats and acts of personal violence from following their lawful occupation. To enforce the edicts mentioned, members of labour unions, whether directly concerned or not, are compelled by their leaders to leave their employment, frequently contrary to their own desire and in disregard of their legal obligations. Employers, in the course of their trade, have also to contend with the fact that labour unions ignore agreements made by them in their corporate capacity with employers if it suits the purpose of the moment to repudiate them. The incidents of the present strike give abundant proof of this assertion. A paper has been delivered to the representatives in conference, explaining the breach of agreement made by the miners in the Northern collieries of New South Wales, and is published, together with a second paper published by the chairman of the Mount Kembla Colliery.  The various decisions of the courts in the colonies in respect to the violation, by the seamen, of their agreements with their employers is further proof. The agreement lately made by the wharf labourers in Sydney was openly violated within a few days of its completion. Sufficient has been said to prove that the present strike has been forced on employers. In opposing it, passive resistance only has been offered, and, while employers have endeavoured to conduct their business by the aid of free labour, they have not sought in any way to assail unionism; although they have Striven to counteract its abuses. The proceedings of the conference are set forth in the following resolutions, which were unanimously adopted by the representatives present: - First resolution, - "That this conference reaffirms the principle of 'freedom of contract' between individual employers and employees, and asserts that any infringement of that principle is not only destructive to commerce but is also inimical to the best interests of the working classes."  Second resolution, - "That any attempt to apply force or the threat of force, or any persuasion other than that permitted and defined by law, to men who are not unionists, or any other form of boycotting, should in the opinion of this conference be resisted by united action." Third resolution, - "This conference is of opinion that employers should declare that they will not be coerced in the dismissal of any labour that has taken service with them in the present emergency, and in the event of any attempt being made to coerce such labour to join any trade organisation, or to interfere with them in the discharge of their daily work, the combined associations represented at this conference will take all possible means to insure their personal safety." Fourth resolution, - "That this conference declares that to maintain discipline, and thus protect life and property, owners of shipping in the coastal and intercolonial trades should not engage or retain in their employ any captains or officers who may be members of a union affiliated with any labour organisations." Fifth resolution, - "That, with a view to the extension of the various employers' unions, it is desirable to encourage employers and others connected with all trades, businesses, and interests to join existing employers' unions, and form other unions where necessary, for mutual protection and defence, upon the basis of resolutions passed; that such unions form federal councils for each colony, that all such federal councils be affiliated and confederated." The conference desires a speedy termination of the present unsatisfactory state of affairs; and to facilitate a resumption of work, employers are urged to proclaim as soon as possible the terms on which engagement will be made.
