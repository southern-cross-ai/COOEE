I'll back my ginger to make a hit,
My fine - my true GAME COCK;
The Swells can't do me in the pit;
I'm down to every lock!
I'm up to all your knowing rigs,
Ye biddies queer and flash;
I'm company for scamps and prigs,
Sometimes for men of cash.
A numerous concourse of persons assembled in the Brickfields on Thursday last, August 8th, 1805, to become spectators of a Cock-fight.
This was in decided opposition against the laws of the Magistracy; but even so, amongst the number were several citizens whose character and conditions in life, should have bettered their curiosity, which could only be gratified in defiance to the present wholesome regulations.
The only circumstances, however, that can be advanced in extenuation of disorder, were the unstudied effusions of loyalty, that were enthusiastically reiterated during the pendency of the feathered contest.
The champion within the lists was no less than Bone-a-part, a powerful party-coloured pile; his antagonist Sir Sidney, a ginger of true English breed.
At setting to they were considered but as birds; until, by the fluctuating accident of war, they were represented to the infatuated imagination as the representatives elect of Nations, whose trophies were to be affected by the issue; and if they themselves were conscious of their own importance the combatants engaged with unexampled bravery.
The genius of combat toward the conclusion inclined to the side of Bony, but his antagonist unable to own a conqueror, in one renovated exertion laid him at his feet. The painful shackles of suspence were broken, and plaudit "sounded through the echoing hall."
Scarce was the battle ended when the appearance of a military party, attended by constables by order of the Superintendant of Police, gave birth to a scene the most grotesque that can possibly be imagined.
In an instant the cocks in reserve were left to settle their own disputes; the setter to set off; the heelers took to their heels; the owners disclaimed their property; and the betters thought proper to decamp without adjusting their accounts.
In beating a retreat many took into Mr. Harris's inclosures, and hoping for the best, pressed forward until they became as fixed as statues, in the centre of the Blackwattle Swamp. They were indebted to the servants of the above Gentleman, assisted by the Constables, for their deliverance.
All that were secured were escorted in, and lodged in gaol, where they remained until they found bail for their appearance when called upon for breaking the peace; and John Cooper, the proprietor of the house at which the turmoil had been held, was ordered by the Superintendant of Police to find bail for his good behaviour (in keeping an orderly house,) for twelve months.
The cocks found on the field of battle, amounting to six in number, were ordered to the Orphan School.
The day following a number of idle people assembled at Mr. Laycock's farm (formerly Boxley's) for the renewal of the sport, supposing themselves out of the reach of the Magistracy; and having finished the cock-fight, concluded the day's amusement by burning down the house.
