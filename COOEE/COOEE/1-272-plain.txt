My dear Cousin
through the Ship Phoenix returning to this Port Consequently has brought the letters and small packet of newspapers back I had sent to you by her / and in addition to the papers I have sent 5 Sydney Gazzettes from 1128 to 1133,5 of Hoares Express from No 9 to 14, 5 Australian from no 38 to 43. The Cash is the same namely the first of a bill of exchange on the Lords of the Treasury and 2nd of bill sent by Broadfoot each for £100 Stg /  the accounts one not yet brought to a close I mentioned in my letter of date July 5th of the Carpeting being left at the Derwent and stored at Bethmu  and Grants, I accordingly wrote them to sell for the best prices could be got and inclosed them the Invoice that came in your letter. I think theire must be a letter of advice but that has not come to hand yet but they had reshiped them on board the Brig Nexus bound for Port Dalrymple at £3 per ton and it is expected she will be a month or six weeks / so you see, through theire mistake it may make a material difference in the Market and expences. I shall not open those Bales / Mrs Thomson is still with me and very anxious to return. Mr T. has written her he is quite tired of being alone I think he will never let her come again without himself, / I got a letter from my son Thomas that they all got down safe and fifteen days passage. their is a young man here by the name of Anderson that Mr Reach  gave a letter of introduction Recommending him strongly / I think he said he was a ministers son / I asked him and Mr Wallace to dine with us which they did and I gave them a General invitation but I never saw either of them with the exception of Mr Wallace. Called one day after when I was very ill, I believe him to be a decent young man. Mr Anderson got a situation in Mr Wentworths office the Barrister who wrote the History of N.S.W. which place he soon left through his incapacity as Mr W. said to fill the situation. I was very much afraid he will do no good here I reed a note from him the other day praying my assistance he being then confined in Goal for the sum of £5.0.0 at the suit of Cuningham the Ship Builders from Leith / I was going to liberate him immeadiatly but a thought struck me to write to Cuningham Concerning him. he sent back for answer Anderson had letters to him from his friends in Leith and in Consequence paid him all the attention in his power and after that lent him £5.0.0 which he had every reason to suppose was not aplied to the best of purposes / Consequently I declined  it. I then recd another note from him saying that Cuningham had agreed to take his note for a month providing he would pay costs which was 40 / - / I immeadiately sent him that sum he promised my servant he whould call on me the next morning after he was out but I understand since it was nothing but a stratagem to get a little money to spend in disapation  / I am told he is a worthless Charracter for which I am very sorry as I know Mr Reach  will be vexed he gave him a letter when my servant took the Money to the goal  he was the bearer of another note from that Davis you gave the memo to the Charracter before I did not send him any thing but I sent to his wife relief who I belive is very badly off. a number of these Emigrants come out and spend what little Cash they have before the offer to do anything for their future prospects the generaly turn out very bad, their are a great many of them so bad or worse than the most depraved Convicts the go about swindling any one they can lay hold of we have instances of it every day with us /  
Mr McArthur is now up on a visit to Sydney I suppose to meet the Arch Deacon to come in for a share of the Church lands, theire is great alterations here now with the Clergy since his arrival we have heard him Mr McArthur several times. I think he is atempting to Tread in Dr Chalmers steps / he Certainly is a very Clever man and I think a very good one. he is now liveing at Mr Wemyss the Commissary he called on Eliza Twice / he expects going down to the Derwent at the time Eliza goes. he is rather too voilent  in the pulpit I am afraid it will Ingure his lungs - we are now dayly expecting our new Governor and the Seretary . I suppose their will be great alterations in our Government but tis all the same to me. I never meddle in polatics. you will see by the papers they are discussing the busness between Dr Douglas and the Revd. I Marsden. tis said that neither perty can make good their aspertions and that Douglas will get his situation as Clerk to the Council with a Salary of 800 per annum / I think I shall be able to let you have the minitures now very shortly. we have got I am told a very Clever man now. Eliza and James is now sitting as they are going down so soon. I shall then be able to judge if he does them well. if so James and Elizabeth will be the next and what whould you say if I where to be the bearer of them myself. if I do come it will be all in a hurry when I have fixed upon it. I do not say I am in earnest but I feel very much inclined. I shall bring Elizabeth with me she is growing the picture of her sister Celia both in figure and every thing I think she is just her height. if we do come we shall stay a few years - poor Mr Wills is just getting into the same way as Celia I think he will soon follow her if he does not very soon take a turn, he is a very fine young man he goes up the Country tomorrow morning to Mr Refesnes his Brother-in-law who is a surgeon and I think the change of air may be of service / I have been packing his things up he says he think he never will be able to come down again alive. the Miss Atkinson and sister to Janes Husband was on Teusday last Married to Capt John Grimes a Native of this Colony. I think it is a good match for her when she came out I understood or it was rather given out she had an engagement in England but as it will tis all over now
the sail tomorrow morning for the Ile of France for sugars & - I inquired about that man Murdock and find. by a servant Maid of Mrs Atkinson who lived sometime in the same place. stays at Mr Oxleys as Cook & his wife as Housekeeper / I coud not find out what he left Mr Murdock for, I expect long ere this you have been Mr Lang the Minister /  he has lost his Brother since his departure a very fine and worthy young man, / as for Mr Warren I cannot say anything about as I belive he is now on a Ship to Newcastle & I had liked to have forgot I wrote to Alice by this Conveyance and I desired her to say to you I wished you whould (if they are alive my old Nurse & her Husband) pay over to them £5.0.0 from that Money you have of mine in the Bank and the rest you may send out in a little investment of which I had advised you I see you are about removing to a larger establishment it is a good sign and believe me I am as anxious about your prosperity as you can possible be and may you many years continue to have your health which is more prescious than Rubys, to you or any one else I hope you will take care of it / some times Relapses one worse than the first atack. I have had some very bad atacks lately of the Astma or with that exat I think I should enjoy a tolerable state of health but never I am afraid I shall be the woman I was Two years ago - I must now beg of you to present my kind compliments to Mr & Mrs Fleming and all inquiring friends Eliza sends her Dear love to you in which Betsy joins remember us all to Mr Cockran and all the young Ladies
I long to be with you again. Mrs. Atkinson also presents her love to you from your ever affectionate Cousin
