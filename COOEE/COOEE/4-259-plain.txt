 we are satisfied to go home to help father and mother now in their old days. But I think it right to one and all that father should settle his affairs. It will not shorten his days one hour but rather lighten them as he would be more content  David and his wife have been keeping a lot of talk about us going home and is angry that they did not get the farm so they would give all the trouble that they could. If he had got some decent respectable woman for his wife I would be only satisfied that he should have got the place as it means a loss to us of about Â£70 per year besides sacrificing our land. But for father, mother and aunt Grace's sake we would, as you say, sacrifice something for them.
