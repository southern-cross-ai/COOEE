4. Subject as in this Act is mentioned there shall be transferred to and vested in the court the jurisdiction which at the commencement of this Act was vested in or capable of being exercised by the Central Criminal Court, or by any Court of Assize, or by the Court of the Chief Judge of Courts of Mines. The jurisdiction by this Act transferred to the court shall include the jurisdiction which at the commencement of this Act was vested in or capable of being exercised by any of the judges of any of the said courts, sitting in court, or at chambers or elsewhere, when acting as a judge in pursuance of any statute, and all powers given to any such court or to any of the said judges by any statute, and also all ministerial powers, duties, and authorities, incident to any and every part of the jurisdiction so transferred.
8. In every civil cause or matter commenced in the court law and equity shall be administered by the court according to the rules following: - 
(1.) If any plaintiff or petitioner claims to be entitled to any equitable estate or right, or to relief upon any equitable ground against any deed, instrument, or contract, or against any right, title, or claim whatsoever asserted by any defendant or respondent in such cause or matter, or to any relief founded upon a legal right, which heretofore could only have been given by a Court of Equity, the court, and every judge thereof, shall give to such plaintiff or petitioner such and the same relief as ought to have been given by the court in its equitable jurisdiction in a suit or proceeding for the same or the like purpose properly instituted before the passing of this Act.
(2.) If any defendant claims to be entitled to any equitable estate or right, or to relief upon any equitable ground against any deed, instrument, or contract, or against any right, title, or claim asserted by any plaintiff or petitioner in such cause or matter, or alleges any ground of equitable defence to any claim of the plaintiff or petitioner in such cause or matter, the court, and every judge thereof, shall give to every equitable estate, right, or ground of relief so claimed, and to every equitable defence so alleged, such and the same effect, by way of defence against the claim of such plaintiff or petitioner, as the court in its equitable jurisdiction ought to have given if the same or the like matters had been relied on by way of defence in any suit or proceeding instituted for the same or the like purpose before the passing of this Act.  
(3.) The court, and every judge thereof, shall also have power to grant to any defendant in respect of any equitable estate or right, or other matter of equity, and also in respect of any legal estate, right, or title claimed or asserted by him all such relief against any plaintiff or petitioner as such defendant shall have properly claimed by his pleading, and as the court, or any judge thereof, might have granted in any suit instituted for that purpose by the same defendant against the same plaintiff or petitioner; and also all such relief relating to or connected with the original subject of the cause or matter, and in like manner claimed against any other person, whether already a party to the same cause or matter or not, who shall have been duly served with notice in writing of such claim pursuant to any rule of court or any order of the court, as might properly have been granted against such person if he had been made a defendant to a cause duly instituted by the said defendant for the same purpose; and every person served with any such notice shall thenceforth be deemed a party to such cause or matter, with the same rights in respect of his defence against such claim as if he had been duly sued in the ordinary way by such defendant.
(4.) The court, and every judge thereof, shall recognise and take notice of all equitable estates, titles, and rights, and all equitable duties and liabilities appearing incidentally in the course of any cause or matter, in the same manner in which the court in its equitable jurisdiction would have recognised and taken notice of the same in any suit or proceeding duly instituted therein before the passing of this Act.
(5.) No cause or proceeding at any time pending in the court shall be restrained by prohibition or injunction; but every matter of equity on which an injunction against the prosecution of any such cause or proceeding might have been obtained if this Act had not passed, either unconditionally or on any terms or conditions, may be relied on by way of defence thereto: Provided always, that nothing in this Act contained shall disable the court from directing a stay of proceedings in any cause or matter pending before it if it shall think fit; and any person, whether a party or not to any such cause or matter who would have been entitled, if this Act had not passed, to apply to the court to restrain the prosecution thereof, or who may be entitled to enforce, by attachment or otherwise, any judgment, decree, rule or order, contrary to which all or any part of the proceedings in such cause or matter may have been taken, shall be at liberty to apply to the court, by motion in a summary way, for a stay of proceedings in such cause or matter, either generally or so far as may be necessary for the purposes of justice, and the court shall thereupon make such order as shall be just. 
(6.) Subject to the aforesaid provisions for giving effect to equitable rights and other matters of equity in manner aforesaid, and to the other express provisions of this Act, the court, and every judge thereof, shall recognise and give effect to all legal claims and demands, and all estates, titles, rights, duties, obligations, and liabilities existing by the common law, or created by any statute, in the same manner as the same would have been recognised and given effect to if this Act had not passed.
(7.) The court, in the exercise of the jurisdiction vested in it by this Act in every cause or matter pending before it, shall have power to grant, and shall grant, either absolutely or on such reasonable terms and conditions as to such court shall seem just, all such remedies whatsoever as any of the parties thereto may appear to be entitled to in respect of any and every legal or equitable claim properly brought forward by them respectively in such cause or matter; so that, as far as possible, all matters so in controversy between the said parties respectively may be completely and finally determined, and all multiplicity of legal proceedings concerning any of such matters avoided.
9. The law to be hereafter administered as to the matters next hereinafter mentioned shall be as follows: - 
(1.) In the administration by the court of the assets of any person who may die after the commencement of this Act, and whose estate may prove to be insufficient for the payment in full of his debts and liabilities, and in the winding-up of any company under "The Companies Statute 1864" whose assets may prove to be insufficient for the payment of its debts and liabilities and the costs of winding-up, the same rules shall prevail and be observed as to the respective rights of secured and unsecured creditors, and as to debts and liabilities provable, and as to the valuation of annuities and future and contingent liabilities respectively, as may be in force for the time being under the law of insolvency with respect to estates placed under sequestration; and all persons who in any such case would be entitled to prove for and receive dividends out of the estate of any such deceased person or out of the assets of any such company may come in under the decree or order for the administration of such estate or under the winding up of such company, and make such claims against the same as they may respectively be entitled to by virtue of this Act:
(2.) No claim of a cestui que trust against his trustee for any property held on an express trust, or in respect of any breach of such trust, shall be held to be barred by any Statute of Limitations:
(3.) An estate for life without impeachment of waste shall not confer or be deemed to have conferred upon the tenant for life any legal right to commit waste of the description known as equitable waste, unless an intention to confer such right shall expressly appear by the instrument creating such estate:
(4.) There shall not, after the commencement of this Act, be any merger by operation of law only of any estate, the beneficial interest in which would not be deemed to be merged or extinguished in equity: 
(5.) A mortgagor entitled for the time being to the possession or receipt of the rents and profits of any land, not being land under the "Transfer of Land Statute," as to which no notice of his intention to take possession or to enter into the receipt of the rents and profits thereof shall have been given by the mortgagee, may sue for such possession, or for the recovery of such rents or profits, or to prevent or recover damages in respect of any trespass or other wrong relative thereto, in his own name only, unless the cause of action arises upon a lease or other contract made by him jointly with any other person:
(5a.) In any action for the foreclosure of the equity of redemption of any mortgaged property, the court may upon the request of the mortgagee, or of any subsequent incumbrancer, or of the mortgagor, or of any person claiming under them respectively, direct a sale of such property instead of a foreclosure of such equity of redemption on such terms as the court may think fit to direct; and if the court shall so think fit without previously determining the priorities of incumbrances, or giving the usual or any time to redeem: Provided that if such request shall be made by any such subsequent incumbrancer, or by the mortgagor, or by any person claiming under them respectively, the court shall not direct any such sale without the consent of the mortgagee or the persons claiming under him, unless the party making such request shall deposit in court a reasonable sum of money, to be fixed by the court, for the purpose of securing the performance of such terms as the court may think fit to impose on the party making such request:
(5b.) No action shall be open to objection on the ground that a merely declaratory judgment is sought thereby, and it shall be lawful for the court to make binding declarations of right without granting consequential relief:
(5c.) If after an action shall have been instituted in relation to any real estate, it shall appear to the court that it will be necessary, or expedient, that the said real estate or any part thereof should be sold for the purposes of such action, it shall be lawful for the court to direct the same to be sold at any time after the institution thereof; and such sale shall be as valid to all intents and purposes as if directed to be made on the trial of such action, and any party to the action in possession of such estate or in receipt of the rents or profits thereof shall be compelled to deliver up possession or receipt to the purchaser or such other person as the court shall direct:
(6.) Any absolute assignment, by writing under the hand of the assignor (not purporting to be by way of charge only), of any debt or other legal chose in action, of which express notice in writing shall have been given to the debtor, trustee, or other person from whom the assignor would have been entitled to receive or claim such debt or chose in action, shall be and be deemed to have been effectual in law (subject to all equities which would have been entitled to priority over the right of the assignee if this Act had not passed), to pass and transfer the legal right to such debt or chose in action from the date of such notice, and all legal and other remedies for the same, and the power to give a good discharge for the same, without the concurrence of the assignor:  Provided always, that if the debtor, trustee, or other person liable in respect of such debt or chose in action shall have had notice that such assignment is disputed by the assignor or any one claiming under him, or of any other opposing or conflicting claims to such debt or chose in action, he shall be entitled, if he think fit, to call upon the several persons making claim thereto to interplead concerning the same, or he may, if he think fit, pay the same into the court under and in conformity with the provisions of the "Statute of Trusts 1864" or any Act amending the same. Provided also that nothing herein contained shall be deemed to affect the provisions of the thirty-ninth section of the Act of the Parliament of Victoria numbered 474:
(6a.) Where any real or personal property shall form the subject of any proceedings in the court, and the court shall be satisfied that the same will be more than sufficient to answer all the claims thereon which ought to be provided for in such action, it shall be lawful for the court, at any time after the commencement of such proceedings, to allow the parties interested therein, or any one or more of them, the whole or part of the annual income of such real property, or a part of such personal property, or a part or the whole of the income thereof, up to such time as the court shall direct, and for that purpose to make such orders as may appear to the court necessary or expedient:
(7.) Stipulations in contracts, as to time or otherwise, which would not before the commencement of this Act have been deemed to be or to have become of the essence of such contracts in a court of equity, shall receive in the court the same construction and effect as they would have heretofore received in equity:
(8.) A mandamus, an injunction, or a writ of ne exeat colonia may be granted or a receiver appointed by an interlocutory order of the court in all cases in which it shall appear to the court to be just or convenient that such order should be made; and any such order may be made either unconditionally or upon such terms and conditions as the court shall think just; and if an injunction is asked, either before, or at, or after the hearing of any cause or matter, to prevent any threatened or apprehended waste or trespass, such injunction may be granted, if the court shall think fit, whether the person against whom such injunction is sought is or is not in possession under any claim of title or otherwise, or (if out of possession) does or does not claim a right to do the act sought to be restrained under any colour of title, and whether the estates claimed by both or by either of the parties are legal or equitable:
(9.) In any cause or proceeding for damages arising out of a collision between two ships, if both ships shall be found to have been in fault, the rules hitherto in force in the Court of Vice-Admiralty, so far as they have been at variance with the rules in force in courts of common law, shall prevail: 
(10.) In questions relating to the custody and education of infants, the rules of equity shall prevail:
