The barbers use them to spray your hair after cutting.  I use it to throw a spray of solution of phenol and water over the combs and brood in a diseased stock of bees. They also can be had at the chemists but I think they charge more. 
One of the young Maddens has been off with toothache for four days but he is now back at work. I got the wire put on the line yesterday but as the have nearly all the piece of ground grubbed, and it will only take them a few days more to finish it, I think it advisable to let them work on till the end of the week and complete it. The trees were very hard to grub owing to having had a lot of tap roots running down and thus involving a great deal of extra labour. It is beautiful soil where the trees are worst to grub being exactly chocolate. 
The Madden's purpose going honey hunting after they get the wire in. I purpose trying to get Bannister's fencing for them. I could not take it with any likelihood of making anything out of it first because I would want a strong draught horse, second because I would not be able to pitch into the work myself. Had I both a horse and plenty of strength, there would be very little in it. 
The reason I want the Maddens to get the job is this. It would give Jima work for a month or two, for we can do without him for a while from a pecuniary point of view and I would keep him, as it were, in my employment. Why I would like to keep him under my eye is this: he is a splendid worker and reliable. After Bannister's fence would be done we could finish the line between our two blocks before stocking at our leisure. I would not fence any more only the small paddock and would only carry a few head. 
We will require 30 new hives next season so I think you would do well to send to America for a list of hives and bee appliances etc as if for Agnew and Co. I believe we could import them much cheaper then we could have them made in Melbourne. You could write to A. J. Root, Medina, Ohio, United States of America. 
After you get the catalogue and list of prices of the bee hives and bee appliances we could then make up our minds how many to send for and get them through Agnew and Co or to yourself whichever would be best. You will have to send away at once as there will be no time to lose between now and the time they will be required and it would be a great loss if the bees would be inclined to swarm and us have no hives ready for them. If the bees get justice they will do us a good turn next season. If the don't, of course we can expect no profit. 
You could send the socks and the phenol and syphon by parcels post as on account of the car, the John and Elizabeth is so uncertain. Be careful how you pack them. I would like to have the goods as soon as possible as I am now beginning to run short. 
I will do as you desired about the cash. I paid for the carriage freight and commission. It, in all, came to Â£6 18s. 0d. 
If you can send the dog with Bannister so much the better for he could tie him on behind the coach. If you send him to Bairnsdale I think the best one would be Scott the draper where you sent the bags and I would get some of the bullock drivers to bring him up. Before you send him away send me a letter saying what day you intended sending him so as I could be on the look out for someone to bring him up and not have Scott keeping him long. You would do well to send Scott word before you send the dog so as he would know to expect him. The parcels man would take him to Scott from the railway.
