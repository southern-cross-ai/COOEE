It is nearly completed and the men will soon start to do a contract of fencing. John has been looking after some cows as we purpose putting on cattle instead of sheep for a few years at any rate as there are wild dogs (or dingoes) in the district and we could not afford to lose any of our little flock. 
Speaking about John's house I can give little information on it only to say that the fireplace and chimney is just like a blacksmith's hob only the hearth is on the floor instead of being raised. The back and sides of the fire is lined with clay instead of mortar and stone to prevent the wood (with which the walls and chimney of the house is built) from catching fire. I shall not attempt to describe it further as I have not been there to see John's house. My description is what I saw of another house in the neighbourhood.
