But when men, who had been convicts, and who were besides disqualified by want of education, or previous mode of life, were appointed magistrates and public functionaries; - when land was distributed with undiscriminating profusion amongst the whole class of emancipated convicts without regard to good or ill conduct ; - when the circumstance of having come free to the colony, conferred no claim to favour; and that of having been convicted became proverbially the best security for preferment; - is it surprising that the free settlers should have expressed their dissatisfaction at the continuance, and their apprehension of the probable results of so extraordinary a system? 
The natural consequence of this system was reaction, - a determination, on the part of the emigrant colonists, to maintain the more strictly those distinctions which it was the object of the Governor to break down.
On the part of the emancipated convicts, on the other hand, it gave rise to claims for full participation in civil rights and political privileges, upon the basis of property alone, without reference to character and conduct. It was the origin also of a feeling, at one time very generally prevalent amongst this class, and which still exists in the minds of many, that the colony was theirs by right, and that the emigrant settlers were interlopers upon the soil.
