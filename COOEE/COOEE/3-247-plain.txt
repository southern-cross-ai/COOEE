 I must inform you that I have been a miner ever since the year after the gold was first discovered (that is to say 1853) which alone supported me till now. The diggings about where I resides is done or deserted almost; only a very few diggers seen at work. There are hundreds of men walking and travelling about looking for employment. Indeed these times it is hard for a man to know what to do to earn an honest living.
