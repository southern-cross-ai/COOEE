My Dear Father 
I received your last letter on 16th. Instant Datd May 30th. 60 which gave us great nsolation to hear from you and to find you all in good health as this leaves us when writing those few lines in perfect good health thank God for his mercy to us. 
Dear Father I received a letter from my sisters in America last January which gave us great pleasure to hear from them. I expect Honora & Husband will come here if they can. I scend the letter to Morten Bay to Mrs. Carrigg which gave her great consolation to hear from them. Michl Carrigg & family are doing very well. I got a letter of late from them. I generally hear from them once a month. 
I got a letter from Thomas Doolan of late. He is in good health. I think he has a notion to go to the Diggings. There has been a large gold field discovered of late called the Snowey River. It is in a very cold climate in winter time. It is about 100 miles from Sydney. It is thought it will be one of the Richest gold fields that has been discovered. There will be a great Rush there after winter that is about the middle of next month. I hope it will turn out good for it was much wanted. Both trade & Labour was geting very dull. There is a great deal geting ready for it in this Town. They can go very near it by sea. 
My dear Father I am living with the one gentleman for the last five years. They are very fond of me. They are frightend I will take a start to these last diggings. I have not made up my mind for it yet. I am very comfortable where I am meself & little family. Patt Neylon is stoping with us always. He is working for a nother large firm in the Town. He works but 5 days in the week. They keep Saturday their Sunday for they are Jews. He has fine times of it. He is a strong able man and no mistake. 
I wrote differant times to Michl. O'Neill I got no Answer from him. I get letters from Mich Ford occasionaly he is in China. His sister Ellen got Married of late to a decent young man. She is a lucky girl and a decent girl. She was not like a good many more of the neighbours if a person done a good turn for them would go and cut your throat to others behind your Back. I expect you know who I mean. I have done a good many things and many good turns (it's not like the old saying self praise is no prais) for other people and it is the poisoneess bite you will get at long last from them, like the black Snake.  I will drop speaking about that affair. 
I would scend you some newspapers but you never told me that you received anny of them that I have scend you. I will scend one along with this letter called the Freeman's Journal, Sydney paper. There is great discussion between the Catholicks and Prespeyterians Minister. They broke the church down &. &. and gave the Minister a good trashing. Next month will be the commencment of spring the wether is beginging to get warm. There is a great deal of Money collecting here for the Holey Father to be scend to Rome. I would like you would Scend me a good catholic paper when you are writing to me again. 
I mentioned that I did not say annything about the childrin in my last letter. They are three as good children as you could wish to see if the Lord spares them. Johney is a regular Neylon he has foxey hair and very strong of his age thank God. You can tell the neighbours that we are all very happy and snug but not very rich. We have comfort in our life as yet scince we got Married. Whatever the Lord pleases to do after we have the beast  of eating & drinking a Â£I in our pocket when we wanted thank God. 
I have not heard from my Sister Bridget this long time past. Patt Neylon & Bridget wishes to be remberd to their Father & Mother Brothers & Sister & to you all. I must conclude with my love to Martin Neylon wife & family my uncles, aunts & relations & all the enquiring neighbours. Let me know how is Martin McDonell for I was dreaming of him of late. I thought I was along with himself & Martin Neylon having a stiff yarn at Derry chappel and to my surprise I found meself in Maitland when I awoke. Not forgeting my Stepmother Brothers & Sisters and you my loving Father I would like to see you. Good by for I must be in time for the Mail it is going on the 21st. Inst.
