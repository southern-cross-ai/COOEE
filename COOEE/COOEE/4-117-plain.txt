I had heard that there was a very good job to be had on the new cable tramways once one could get on. I applied and was informed that I was the sort of men they wanted and if I could get a good reference from some respectable person they would give me a trial. So Mr. Agnew my old benefactor furnished me with a character that would have pleased anybody. I went for training on last Monday week and passed on my seventh day's practise. I got my certificate and was told they would send for me when the new lines opened, as there are several under construction at present. It will unfortunately be three or perhaps six months before I will get on. I will be what is called engineer (a rather big word for what I will have to do). It is commonly called gripman. The tram-car is drawn by an endless rope running on underground pullies driven by a stationary engine of great power. The cable runs underneath the pavement between the runs and is caught by a grip wrought by a lever which passed down through a groove about two inches wide. The rope never stops but slips through the grip when the car is at a standstill. There are as many as 20 of these cars all on the rope at once
