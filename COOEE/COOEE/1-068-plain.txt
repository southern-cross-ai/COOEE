The land appears to be covered with water in wet seasons. Came to a salt lagoon about a mile long and a quarter of a mile wide; had not entrance to the sea Soon afterwards came to a large river 2; went up it about a mile when we turned back and waited for the boat to take us on board, The ground is a swamp on one side and high on the other. Saw many swans, pelicans, and ducks. Were obliged to go up to our middle to get to the boat, and got on board between five and six o'clock. Rain and thunder in the night.  
Thursday, 3rd. - At six o'clock the captain, Mr. Grimes, self, and five seamen went in the boat up the Great River; at between two and three miles it divided into two we took the left hand stream at half past eight o'clock. The land became high, where we landed and went on a hill. The soil a reddish loam from ten to fifteen inches deep. Saw a large lagoon at a distance. Went over the hill to a large swamp.  Soil black, eighteen inches, with blue clay at bottom. No trees for many miles. Came to the boat and proceeded on; passed two dingles; no water; came to a third where we found some water, where we dined and proceeded on. Opposite this the land is stony soil, stiff blue clay, and no trees only some straggling oaks by the side of the river. We went up time river till we came to rocks; could not get the boat over; crossed it at a place the natives had made for catching fish. It was still salt though a great fall; went about two miles on the hills which are level at top and full of stones, the land very had, and very few trees, and appeared so to the mountains, which appeared clothed with timber. On our return back came to the river a little higher up and found it excellent fresh water, where it divided and appeared deep enough for a boat. Just as we got to the boat it began to thunder and rain. Stopped a little time and came back till we could procure wood to make a fire, and it being sunset stopped the night.  
Friday, 4th. - Started at six and came to the branch we passed before, at the entrance the land swampy; a few miles up found it excellent water, where we saw a little hill and landed. The dinner was getting ready Messrs. Robbins, Grimes, and self went on the hill, where we saw the lagoon seen from the hill where we first landed. It is in a large swamp between time two rivers; fine grass, fit to mow; not a bush in it. The soil is black rich earth about six to ten inches deep, when it is very hard and stiff. It is better farther back. About two miles further went on shore again; the land much better and timber larger. Soil black, ten to fifteen inches deep; bottom sand or gravel I went to the other side where the ground was time same; went in about two miles; it began to rain. I returned to the boat and after dinner we all got on board and arrived on board the vessel at dusk. Saw a canoe and two native huts.
