SYDNEY, Tuesday, September 7, 1830.
At one o'clock, yesterday, Major Smeathman, and a jury, held an inquest at the Fox and Hounds, Castlereaghstreet, on the body of John Donahoe, a prisoner of the Crown, by the Ann and Amelia. Having proceeded to view the body at the General Hospital, upon their return the following evidence was gone into.
Michael Gorman said: I am a constable to Major Antill, of Stone-quarry Creek, and hold a Ticket-of-Leave. On the afternoon of the 1st instant, I was on duty in the neighbourhood of Bringelly, about a mile and a-half from Mr Lowe's. There were two constables, and six of the mounted police in company with me, and we had been in the bush for the fortnight previous in search of Donahoe, Walmsley and Webber.
About o'clock, our sentry saw a person, whom he took for Mr Farley, the Chief Constable, who had gone for provisions. We thereupon got up, and perceived at a considerable distance (I suppose a mile and a half), three men and a horse, which appeared to have a pack-saddle upon it. This horse was black, and as Mr Fancy's horse was grey, we knew it could not be him. The sergeant then ordered us to pursue. The bushrangers were at this time near the bank of a creek, and to avoid losing them if they crossed, we separated, the sergeant and two men proceeded along the left side, while, myself and others, went cautiously to the right. This was on Mr Wentworth's farm. We got to within a hundred yards of them unperceived, when suddenly espying us, they made preparations for defence, and Donahoe exclaimed, "Come on, you cowardly rascals, we are ready if there's a dozen of you The bushrangers then got each behind a tree, and a conversation of some length ensued, about fighting.
After a lapse of nearly half an hour, one of the policemen fired, his shot knocking the bark from the tree behind which Webber was situated. I now levelled my piece, which went off at the same moment with those discharged by two of the robbers. In about another minute one of the soldiers named Muckleston, fired, and I instantly saw the man now stated to be Donahoe fall. We pursued the others and after going a considerable pace, in consequence of the night coming on, were compelled to give over the pursuit.
John Muckleston corroborated the testimony of the last witness, and stated further, that the bushrangers were in a hollow surrounded by bush, by which means they were prevented from observing our approach. When Donahoe saw us he took his hat off waved it three times, threw it in the air, and bid us defiance in the language made use of by the last witness.
Wm. Hodson sworn - I am a sergeant of the 57th, and attached to the mounted police. I was out in the neighbourhood of Bringelly on the 1st instant, under orders from Mr M'Arthur and Mr M'Allister to scour the bush thoroughly, and remain out till I brought in Donahoe, Waimsicy and Webber, who, from previous information were known to be in that direction. The latter two were known to me, and Dr Gibson stated that he knew the other to be Donahoe, who was described as a native of Dublin, 23 years of age, five feet four inches in height, brown freckled complexion, flaxen hair, blue eyes and has a scar under the left nostril. When we returned to Donahoe, he was in his last agonies. One ball had entered his neck and the other his forehead, Private Muckleston having loaded his with a carbine ball and a pistol ball. I kept the body where we were for the night, and brought it to Liverpool and then to Sydney last Saturday, together with the property found on the pack-horse. The witness here produced a watch, several deeds, grants of land and transfers, together with some female wearing apparel, about 150 lbs of flour and some meat. The papers were all identified as the property of a person named Begley, residing at Prospect, from whom they were stolen about a week before. The jury after consulting about five minutes, returned the verdict of - Justifiable homicide.
Thus is the Colony rid of one of the most dangerous spirits that ever infested it, and happy would it be were those of like disposition to take warning by bold Jack Donahoe's awful fate.
