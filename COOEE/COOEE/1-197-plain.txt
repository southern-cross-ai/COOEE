GOVERNMENT AND GENERAL ORDERS.
Government House, Sidney, Monday, July 16th 1821.
CIVIL DEPARTMENT. His Excellency the Governor in Chief, having returned a few days ago to the seat of Government, from his late tour of inspection through the dependency of Van Dieman's land, deems it expedient to give publicity to the following narrative of his voyage to, his progress through, and his return from, that dependency; especially for the information of those who may be desirous of being acquainted with the nature of the soil, and the state of cultivation to which that dependency has arrived.  
1. His Excellency, family, and suite, embarked in the ship Midas, Captain Beveridge, for Van Dieman's Land, on the 4th of April last. At an early hour on the next morning, the ship got clear of the heads of Port Jackson, and had proceeded some way to the southward, when the wind became contrary, and blew so strong, that she was obliged to return in the evening of the 6th to Port Jackson.
Early on the 13th, the ship got again under weigh, and arrived at Hobart Town, on the River Derwent, in Van Dieman's Land, on the morning of Tuesday the 24th, after a voyage of eleven days.
His excellency's arrival being expected, his landing was marked by every degree of attention and respest  by his Honour Lieutenant Governor Sorell, the civil and military Officers of Government, and the principal inhabitants, which his station or personal regard could dictate.  
2. It was with much satisfaction his Excellency beheld the numerous changes and improvements which Hobart Town had undergone, since the period of his former visit in 1811. The wretched huts and cottages, of which it then consisted, being now converted into regular substantial buildings, and the whole laid out in regular streets; several of the houses being two stories high, spacious, and not deficient in architectural taste. The principal public buildings which have been erected, are a Government House, a handsome church, a commodious military barrack, a strong jail, a well constructed hospital, and a roomy barrack for convicts, which latter is now nearly completed.
The Governor had the curiosity to ascertain the number of houses and population of the town; the former he found to consist of no less than 121 houses, and the inhabitants to amount to upwards of 2700 souls.
On the stream, which passes through the town, there have been four watermills erected for the grinding of grain, and a neat battery has been constructed on Mulgrave Point, at the entrance of Sullivan's Cove;  and on Mount Nelson a signal post and telegraph have been established. The Governor observed also, with much pleasure, the well directed attention which has been displayed towards the accommodation of the shipping interests, in the planning of a large substantial pier or quay, which is now in progess  in Sullivan's Cove, for the convenience of ships or vessels trading thither, in the loading and unloading of their cargoes; which work, combined with the natural facilities of the place, will render Sullivan's Cove one of the best and safest anchorages in the world.
3. The industry and spirit of enterprise, exhibited generally by the inhabitants of Hobart Town, bespeak a favourable opinion of their manners; and the numerous comforts enjoyed by them, as the result of their application, mark the certain reward which will ever be attendant on persevering industry; whilst the prevailing desire for the improvement of the town, bids fair to render it one of the handsomest and most flourishing Australia.  
4. In this tribute to the inhabitants, it would be injustice not to refer much of the prevailing spirit of industry to the wise regulations and judicious arrangements of his Honour Lieutenant Sorell, under whose administration, during the short period of little more than four years, all the principal public buildings, and the greater part of the private ones, have been erected; and the various other improvements have flowed from the same source.
Beholding these rapid, extensive, and ornamental improvements of Hobart Town, the Governor cannot sufficiently express his admiration of the superior talents and exertions of Lieutenant Governor Sorell, by whom, they have, been thus so happily produced, or so effectually promoted.
5. Having surveyed, with much pleasure all the public works and buildings at this time in progress, or already completed in the town and neighbourhood of Hobart Town, the Governor proceeded on. his tour to Port Dalrymple, on the 5th of May, for the purpose of inspecting the settlements in that part of the Island;  and in addition to his personal staff and suite, was accompanied by his Honour Lieutenant- Governor Sorell, and the Honourable Judge Advocate Wylde. On the 10th, his Excellency arrived at Launceston, being received by Lieutenant-Colonel Cimetiere, Commandant of Port Dalrymple, the officers, civil and military, and the prinpal  inhabitants of that station, with the most marked attention and respect.
6. After spending a few days at Launceston, during which he inspected the several public establishments at that place, the Governor proceeded by water down the river Tamer, to the lately erected settlement of 11 George Town, seat at York Cove, near the entrance of Port Dalrymple, and within a few miles of Bass's Straits.
His Excellency felt agreeably surprised at beholding the very considerable progress lately made in the erection of the more immediately requisite public buildings at this new station, much of which progress may be attributed to the personal superintendance of the Commandant, whose head quarters had been with that view removed thither from Launceston in May 1819.  
To Lieutenant-Colonel Cimetiere, the Governor is accordingly much indebted for the zeal and attention he has so beneficially exhibited in carrying his instructions, in regard to George Town into effect.
His Excellency derived particular satisfaction from observing that the troops and convicts have been respectively most comfortably accommodated; -the former having a very good barrack, and the latter neat huts, with gardens adjoining, sufficiently large to supply vegetables in abundance.
The chief buildings completed in George Town are - the Commandant's house; quarters for the civil and military officers; a commodious parsonage house; a jail; a guard-house; and a temporary provision store; and there is a temporary chapel, and a large schoolhouse in progress, and nearly completed. The situation of George Town is not only beautiful, but also admirably adapted for all the purposes of trade, being situated on the banks of a river navigable for ships of large burthen, and but -a short way removed from the sea in Bass's Straits; and has the advantage of a plentiful supply of fresh water from springs in its immediate neighbourhood.  
The Governor, having spent three days in admiring the progress of the new settlement, of George Town, returned to Launceston on Saturday the 29th of May, taking his route by land with the purpose of examining the road some time since opened between those stations, being a distance of 54 miles. Owing to the original bad construction of this road, his Excellency found it nearly impassible for any sort of wheel carriage which induced him to give directions for its being immediately and thoroughly repaired, for the accommodation of the inhabitants at each place.
7. The Governor, having found the original public buildings at Launceston in such a state of dilapidation and decay, as to be altogether incapable of being repaired; whilst, at the same time, such buildings are indispensable, has given orders for the following to be forthwith erected, viz.
1. A Jail.  
2. A Military Barrack.
3. An Hospital.
4. A Commissariat store, and granary.
5. A Barrack, for one Military Officer; and
6. A Barrack for an Assistant-Surgeon.
The only good building for the public service being confined to a school-house and temporary chapel, which has been lately built, and is strong and substantial.
8. Having surveyed, with much pleasure, the principal agricultural settlements near Launceston, the Governor took leave of that part of the Island, and proceeded, on the 28th of May, on his return to Hobart Town, visiting the intermediate agricultural and pasturage farms, including the districts of New Norfolk and Macquarie, situated on the banks of the river Derwent, above Elizabeth Town.
On his route from Launceston to Hobart Town, his Excellency was induced, from local circumstances, to mark out sites of four townships; namely,
1 "Perth," - on the left bank of the river South Esk; 14 miles from Launceston.  
2. "Campbell Town," - on the north bank of the Elizabeth River; 28 miles from Perth.
3, "Oatlands," - on the bank of Jericho Lagoon, in Westmoreland Plains; 50 miles from Campbell Town; and 
4. " Brighton," - on that part Bagdad Plains, formed by the River Jordan, and "Strathallan Creek," 85 miles from Oatlands, and 15 from Hobart Town; -
All of which are arranged with a due consideration to the accommodation and convenience of new settlers, they being all seated in the midst of extensive tracts of rich hand, and forming, at the same time, a regular chain of stations between Hobart Town and Launceston, whereby the journeying between those places will be rendered both safe and convenient.
With this view of the importance of these townships, his Excellency has instructed the Lieutenant-Governor of Van Dieman's Land to pay an early attention to their establishment, and to encourage useful mechanics to establish themselves at them.
9. On Saturday, the 9th of June, the Governor arrived at Hobart Town, and has to express himself much surprised, and highly gratified, by the rapid state of improvement in which he found the several districts through which his route from Launceston to Hobart Town had led him.  
10. On the 20th June, the Governor accompanied by Lieutenant-Governor Sorell, and their respective suites, made an excursion to the districts of Pitt Water, and the Coal River, and was particularly gratified in beholding the highly improved state of those beautiful and rich agricultural settlements :-the agricultural settlers carrying on their farming concerns there on a much more extensive scale than any others in Van Dieman's Land.
In the district of Pitt Water, a portion of land having been reserved for the purpose of a township, his Excellency, finding it admirably circumstanced for that object, being in the midst of a rich soil, and well watered, approved of its location; and, in compliment to Lieutenant Governor Sorell, named the township "Sorell." - Some progress has been already made at this place in buildings:  - a jail has been erected, and the site of a schoolhouse, and temporary chapel marked out, which is to be shortly commenced.
11. The various roads, well constructed, leading from Hobart Town to the different settlements in the interior, together with the strong bridges thrown across the streams and creeks crossing those roads, could not fail to excite his Excellency's surprise and admiration, finding that thereby the intercourse between Hobart Town and all the principal farming establishments, on both sides of the River Derwent was rendered so very easy and convenient.
On the great line of road from Hobart Town to Port Dalrymple, one portion extending as far as the north side of Constitution Hill being nearly completed; another line extends as far as the Coal River and Pitt Water district; and a third leads to the Macquarie district, through New Norfolk, and including the settlements there on both sides of the Derwent. These roads, which have been projected by, and executed under the superintendence of Major Bell, C. B. of the 48th regiment, acting Engineer and Inspector of Public Works at Hobart Town, appear to have been most judiciously laid out and expeditiously constructed, and reflect much credit on that gentleman's zeal for the public service.  It is unnecessary to dwell on the innumerable benefits resulting from the country being thus intersected with good roads, the advantages being felt and duly appreciated by the settlers at large; and the entire line from Hobart Town to Launceston, a distance of 120 miles, which is now in rapid progress from both extremities, will be completed as soon as the numerous gangs placed on it can possibly effect so very great and important an undertaking.
12. From this interesting excursion, his Excellency returned to Hobart Town on the 22d ultimo; and it now chiefly remains for him to express the high feelings of gratification which he experienced throughout every part of his tour, arising from the happy situation of the people, the fertility of the soil, and the beauty of the country at large; all aided by the wise, judicious, and successful exertions of his Honour, Lieutenant-Governor Sorell, who appears to be indefatigable in projecting, and carrying into effect, all those measures which, by being persevered in, must raise Van Dieman's Land, at no very distant day, to the proud distinction of being one of the most valuable colonies belonging to the Crown.  The recent influx of several respectable free settlers, with considerable property, will not fail, under the auspices of Lieutenant-Governor Sorell, to hasten that period at which Van Dieman's Land will hold a high rank among the settlements of the British empire. According to a census, which had been completed only some little time previous to the Governor's arrival at Hobart Town, his Excellency is enabled to state the following particulars; namely, - That the population of Van Dieman's Land is 6372 souls, exclusive of the civil and military officers; and that it contains no less than 28,838 head of horned cattle, 182,468 sheep, 421 horses, and 10,683 acres of land in cultivation.
His Excellency was also happy to observe, that, by the introduction of the Merino breed of sheep, some of which have been lately imported direct from England, and still many more, sent by this Government from the extensive flocks of the pure Merino breed, belonging to John M'Arthur, Esq. that the wool is much improved, and though perhaps it may not altogether rival that produced in this part of the territory, yet it will soon attain such a degree of perfection, as will render it a most valuable export to the mother country.  
13. His Excellency has much pleasure in declaring, that every information he required from the public departments in Van Dieman's Land, was furnished with the utmost promptitude and correctness, and the officers, civil and military, at the heads of those departments, are entitled to, and he hopes for their acceptance of his thanks, and approbation of their conduct therein.
And his Excellency further feels it due to every class of the inhabitants in Van Dieman's Land, to express himself much gratified by the marked attention, kindness, and respect which he experienced, invariably, from the inhabitants, during the whole period of his tour; and he will always retain a pleasing remembrance of the good will and obliging disposition manifested by them towards his Excellency personally.  
14. All the objects of this tour of inspection being effected, his Excellency, family, and suite, and accompanied by the Honourable Judge Advocate Wylde, embarked on board the ship Caroline, at Hobart Town, on the 30th ultimo; and arrived safe at Sydney, on the 12th instant, after an absence of nearly three months from head-quarters.
By order of his Excellency,
FREDERICK GOULBURN, 
Colonial Secretary.
