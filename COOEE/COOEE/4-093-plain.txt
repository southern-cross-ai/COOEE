 I see by the paper that there has been a great fuss made about the Prince and Princess. I would like to know what the Prince ever done for Ireland that merits such an enthusiastic welcome. Undoubtedly the Princess has done what she could to forward Irish manufactory by patronizing the Irish lace and poplin. The Belfast people are always making fools of themselves. What is royalty? What good do they do for the middle and lower classes of Great Britain? They are the people who live by the sweat of their subject's brow. They are the people who think themselves made of better clay than their subjects. They are the people who mean people bend their heads and knee - for what? For thinking themselves better than they. The aristocracy do well to look down on laity or democracy. 
Surely people will see through such nonsense by and by. They have not learned the lesson which the United States have been teaching them these many years past; but I believe the aristocracy has nearly seen its day in England. They have had to cave in a good deal the last few centuries. I believe the franchise has been a blow which will be felt by them at the next general election. It is hoped that the people of the Co. Down will have learned some sense and will look better after their own interests. In fact they, like most of their North of Ireland neighbours, do not quite understand politics and always keep mixing it and religion up together. They seem not to know that politics and religion are two things as widely different as the can be. Politics belong to this world and religion to that which is to come. The one our temporal benefit and the other our spiritual welfare. 
The Orangemen have been a great hindrance to the advancement of civil liberties of the people at home. But poor men, the know not what the do and are simply guided by the aristocracy who use them with great dexterity to suit their own ends. There is no shout about loyalty, no waving of their filthy flag over people's heads here.
