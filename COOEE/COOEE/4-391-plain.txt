But as you remark his letters are never very explicit and show great indecision. Of course he is young, and soft, and all these little things will sharpen his wits. You doubtless know that his partner was broken and that poor Lewis was swamped in the flood to the tune of all his little fortune. I think myself he got into the hands of sharpers at Auckland as surely he would never leave his money in his box and how is it he didn't come on to Albany, WA as he must have had a through ticket. Of course he might explain these things, but in his letter he gives no explanations at all. He has saved £5 where he is and when he makes it up to £10 he will come on. I am afraid he has been in bad hands all through. 
The Balingup brook is a tributary of the Blackwood and the town site and station are called Balingup too. Powalup is the black's name for the junction of the two. I enclose a map showing position of block and how I was enabled to get so much river frontage. Water being scarce in WA the Government only give a certain frontage running you back till you have the quantity of land applied for in a long narrow block but by taking a big block in the bend and there being a block at the back they had no help for it. 
I have finished the fence and am getting the ground clear for my fruit trees coming in June from Melbourne. I am very fond of fruit growing. The pruning etc is very interesting, if carried out scientifically and the profits, just now, are enormous. Apples in the winter go up to 1s.6d. per lb. as there are no foreign or inter-colonial apples allowed into Western Australia for fear of disease, etc. The importation of vines is disallowed but anyone will give you the cuttings. One or two trellised round the house are all I will require for jam and eating. 
The rosella is the parrot you mean. They are worse than the rook at home for corn and I have shot hundreds. Snakes are only thick in the damp places. An Irish rush meadow like the one in front of Clogher cottage would be the very place for them. Of course we often kill them about the houses but a snake as a rule will always scoot when he hears you coming. 
I enclose a bit of the black cockatoo tail feather, peculiar I believe to WA, untameable and nearly extinct.
