 there is nothing in this world grieves me but the delay of you and family  my son Thomas can't come in the same ship with you for being of age and the best thing that he can do is to go to the captain of the ship and enter with him as a working hand if he don't engage with the Captain he is sure to come in the next meal ship that leaves Ireland.
