Sir,
Probably you will be a little surprised at receiving this unexpected line, but as a circumstance hath occurred in this Colony which I am pursuaded will be gratifying to you I have taken the liberty to communicate it. On the 20th of this month on the very day Governors Hunter's Commission was read we received information that the cattle which were lost about seven years ago were found. They have not yet been brought into Camp neither have their number been fully ascertained. The men who found them told thirty-nine three large bulls - and the rest cows and calves - they imagine there are many more than the above number. I remember you contended very strongly when I was in England that the Cows were not destroyed but that they would in future be found, which is now proved to be the ease. Another very singular circumstance hath also happened lately. About five years age some convicts left the Colony in an open boat in hopes of making their escape, four of whom a few days ago were found by Captain Broughton (who commands his Majesties ship "Providence" 20 guns which is sent out here on discovery) in Port Stevens, and brought to Port Jackson.  
They have never been heard of for these five years past and have all this time been living amongst the natives of New Holland. I have not yet had an opportunity of learning how these men have spent their time amongst the poor savages. They were quite naked like the miserable natives when Captain Breughton met with them.
With respect to the Colony it prospers much. Cultivation goes on very rapidly. At present we have the prospect of a very large crop of wheat which will be ready for reaping in November. I think it one of the finest countries in the known world and no people I believe will be more happy than the people of this island in a short time. Our live stock increases very fast. I suppose there are not less than 1400 female goats and sheep in the colony at present and these have young twice in a year. We are now totally independent of foreign countries for dry provisions and in three or four years shall have plenty of animal food. I wish we had some thousands of the poor English families here, we would soon make them very comfortable. I have lately visited Norfolk Island. The inhabitants there are well provided for. They have both plenty of dry provisions and animals raised by themselves. You may purchase a good fowl for sixpence and a Duck for ten-pence or a shilling. They have the greatest plenty of fresh pork. Should you hear any reports of the sufferings of the people here they ought not to be believed, such reports must in a great measure be false.
Should this short letter written in the greatest haste (as the ship is already gone down the Harbour) afford you one moments amusement, I shall be happily recompensed for my trouble.
Mrs. Marsden joins me in kind respects to you and Mrs. Stokes.
I am Dear Sir
Yours &c &c
SAMUEL MARSDEN.
