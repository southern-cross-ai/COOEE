Much to my surprise in December last, I received a particularly choice box of seeds, and your polite note requesting a return of the native seeds of Augusta. In truth, my dear Sir, I much fear you have bestowed your liberality on one whose chief pleasure is her Garden, but who does not enter the lists as a Florist, much less a Botanist. If we were nearer, I should much hesitate to accept so magnificent a present of so many long wished for Seeds, and as all my former pursuits have necessarily been thrown aside (by the peremptory demand of my personal attention to my children and domestic drudgery), I feel that it will be long ere I can make any adequate return in Australian productions.
We have already collected some seeds, as your box just arrived at the proper season. I am not even acquainted with the names of the native plants. I will, however, enclose a leaf and description of the flower in each paper. I had some dried plants by me from the Vasse, a country apparently possessing some exquisite floral beauties, which I feel most happy in being able to send, and when I obtain a sufficiency to make up a small box, I will despatch it and retain the large one until I am blest with more leisure than at present. Another impediment to our being able to procure seeds is our approaching removal to the Vasse, where Captain Molloy's larger grant is situated, but if you do not hear from me shortly, I trust that you will not consider me negligent or unmindful of your humble request. I have put some of my old acquaintances (of whom there are but few in this busy Colony) in requisition, and shall feel myself in duty bound to transmit to you their labours.  Although my brother George was anxious to employ me as a collector also my time is so much infringed on I have not as yet sent him any specimens.
It is with much regret that I leave dear Augusta. Our climate is so heavenly and the scenery is so superior to other settlements, the flowers scentless but minutely beautiful. I am told we possess many unknown in the other parts of this Colony.
