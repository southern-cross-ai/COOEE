I am happy to say it came safely, and the things were not in the least injured by salt water. I am extremely obliged to you for your share of its contents. The dress we much admire and the books. The sermons Henry is much pleased with as well as the numerous other presents which we both dearly appreciate, as coming from you and fancying to have been made by yourself...
I have a sister with me so do not feel the loneliness of the bush much, although you may imagine I am a close housekeeper when I tell you that till last week I had not been out of the valley for more than two years, but the fact is there is little inducement to go beyond it, the Mountain is so steep. While I was up I visited all the ladies in the neighbourhood who are not very numerous, they are very agreeable persons. I remained two or three days, and although the distance was only 16 miles, I was so fatigued that I was glad to get home. I rode up and down the mountain and drove in a gig the rest of the way I saw no part of the country anything to equal our own beautiful valley, and persons do not seem to attend to the cultivation of their gardens or else the climate is not so favourable. Ours is very pleasantly situated, the verandah opens into it, which affords the opportunity of amusing our-selves when we feel inclined to garden. Little Laura is already becoming a most useful assistant to her Papa, although I fear she destroys more flowers than she cultivates. Our peach trees, grapes, strawberries and raspberries promise well.
You wished to know how I amused myself, I can assure you, what with visitors calling as they often do three or four together, people living in this country being obliged to keep sort of open house for travellers, particularly at this distance, where there are no Inns, and my dear little ones and work, I find any time fully occupied. Henry takes us for a ramble occasionally between the Mountain ranges, where at this season of the year most beautiful wild flowers grow, the rock lily is a splendid flower.  You would be astonished to see it growing on a solid block of granite without the slightest appearance of earth about.
