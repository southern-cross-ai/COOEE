I have only a little time before retiring for the Night to write to you dearest for we have been so busy all day a house full of company that I have not had time to begin to write to you before. I received your dearly prized letter on Wednesday but was sorry to hear that you had caught a cold You must take great care of yourself or you will be ill I think it is my turn to talk to you now. I was thinking of yesterday when we did our walk to the Cave we had a very pleasant one indeed & we all climbed up those high rocks & stood & admired the scenery just where you & I stood but I think I looked more at the scenery to day than when you  with me I could not see that day but I blame you for it I was sorry you did not see Ted when you went to White Horse Gully but am glad you enjoyed your walk I am sure when you have time (when I come to Ballaraat) I shall only be to delighted to take the same walk with you & then we shall both be able to enjoy it together Harry Bannister is down he is staying here. William will be up at the latter end of next week I will send a short letter by him I have not asked him what you told me at present about being down in August perhaps I may but I dont much like saying it to him do you not think it would be better for you to do it but I will if you wish me particulary You ask me if I have read the ceremony over indeed dear Walter I have not neither shall I perhaps you will think me superstitious (well I think I am a little though I try to break myself of it) but they say you have 3 years bad luck so I will not read it for fear so please do not ask me. I like those verses very much indeed they are very pretty. I am indeed very fond of poetry though as you say I cannot write them. I will indeed dearest Walter write to your dear Mother if you wish I am sure nothing would give me greater pleasure if you think it would please her I wish I could see her but I can fancy & I am sure I should love her l would do any thing to make her happy if she will but let me & I will do all I can to make you happy dear Walter but as you say we all have our faults & I am afraid mine are very numerous but I will do all I can to become better & you dear Walter must help me I am afraid you will find me rather awkward at first but you must bear with me. You say that if I can do without society &c - indeed & I can I am one that cares very little about & besides what shall I want when I am married but you dear I am sure you will be enough I know no one scarcely but Mrs Bradshaw's family for I have been here so long that I am known as Miss Bradshaw so there will only be my Brothers & sister Rebecca up at Ballaraat. We all feel very fatigued after our long walk this afternoon so you will excuse me writing this so badly & my headaches dreadful I have not been well all the week I have had an attack of Influenza so I do not feel very well just yet I think it will go round the house I think Mrs B. has it she seems very poorley. You made a very good excuse for Brooke but I do not know what you will say when I tell you that he has not written yet. 
Now what excuse can you make for him? If you should see or hear from him Just you ask him how he would like to see poor Polly wasted sulky & pale fretting about but he must expect it & to see the looks when any one comes from town the anxious have you any letters "No Miss" how would he like it I wonder? I am glad to say that Mrs Jeffs have returned Ellen has written & ask's whether Mary has had any more letters from Dr. R. & if she answers them if so to give her kind remembrance to him so I send it I have not answered it yet but must to morrow Dear Polly & Tilly send their kind love also Mother & hoping dearest that you will excuse this scrawl I must think of saying Good Bye but not before I return you many thanks for what I asked you for the lock of hair I prize it very much I hope I shall hear from you on Wednesday & with very best love & kisses Mary
BELIEVE ME DEAR DEAR WALTER TO REMAIN / YOUR SINCERE & LOVING / MARY
