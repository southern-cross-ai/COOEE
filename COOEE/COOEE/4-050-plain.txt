You are very dear to me my darling, and you know your little girl does love you so much and longs so much to be with you darling, I do get so tired of the waiting especially when no letter comes and it seems as though the time would never pass. But I suppose it will come some day and then we will be so happy, I shall have my own Alick and won't your little girl be proud of her big handsome husband, so proud and happy that I will not know what to do to express my joy.
