My dear Matilda 
We were greatly pleased to hear from you as I often wished to know how you were getting on with the dear children since poor Thomas's removal. We heard of it first from a family named McMinn who ha it from their friends in Newry. I considered you would go to your Mother, its well you had her. I am very glad to hear Susan is well & hope she may out grow her delicacy, & I expect Edward has grown a steady boy. Say more about them in your next. 
My six are thank God all well. Johnny the youngest is a very fine boy 15 months old. I am still nursing him. He does not take any food this hot weather except an egg. This climate is very trying to young children particularly when teething. He has got 10. 
Your Uncle is with Mr Bagot the wine merchant at £2-0-0 per week. It's all he asked as business is bad but when it improves he is to advance him. I cant complain. I consider we have done very well to keep ourselves with a large young family. But God has done more for us to keep us in health & strenght. I assure I do a great deal to assist us in the way of keeping cows & poultry, but I like it. Robert is on his 3rd year at a Drapers. He had £10 the first £20 the 2nd & £30 this last year & if he gives satisfaction (which he has done heretofore) he is to get £30 or £40 as a gift at the expiration. He is a very good boy beloved by every one who knows him. Fanny is nearly as tall as myself going to school as are the rest. But Isabella told you all that. 
I like this place much better than I did & dont know should I go home now if I could, not unless I took home plenty of money to keep me independant. I dont doubt you could do very well here if Edward was able to assist you, but I should not like to induce anyone. Peoples opinions tast & distastes differ so much. I never wished to come out but now that I am here I  contented & happy & with the blessing of Providence I trust as the children grow up we shall do much better. 
Please give my very dear love to your aunt Lucy. Tell her I shall write soon. She is at Bakers in Johnstons place (a Quakers). Your aunt Nancy, Mary, Bessie & George went to New York.  Charley remained in Dublin. Isabella came up after tea so I had not time to write much after putting Baby to bed & she goes back tonight being cooler than the morng. Give my love to your Mother & kiss the children for me & ever believe me your very affectionate aunt

Excuse this.
