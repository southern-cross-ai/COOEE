When Emigrants of the above description, and between the Ages of 15 and 30, are Members of Families which are about to proceed to New South Wales or Van Dieman's  Land, they will, on applying to the Commissioners for Emigration, be furnished with Orders, payable in the Colony, for the above mentioned Sum of £8. This Money will be paid at the option of the Emigrants either to the Heads of their Families or to the Captains of the Ships in which they are conveyed. 
3rdly. Females desirous to Emigrate to New South Wales or Van Dieman's Land, and not forming part of any family proceeding to those Colonies, are required to send in an account of (certain particulars).
If they be between the Ages of 18 and 30, and possess the Funds which would be necessary, in addition to the Sum allowed by the Commissioners, to complete the price of their Passage, they will be admitted as candidates for the Bounty of Government: as soon as a sufficient number of such Persons shall have signified their wish to Emigrate, they will be called upon to pay into the Hands of an Officer appointed for that purpose their share of the charge of the Passage, and the Commissioners will then take up a Vessel (into which no other Passengers will be admitted) for the conveyance of these Emigrants to their destination.

Females, who may offer to pay a larger proportion than others of the cost of their Passage, will also be considered entitled to a preference.
