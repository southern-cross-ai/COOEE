Well I went and when I went into the shop Mr. McLean, the governor, said he was sorry I had come up so soon as he thought he would sell the business over again if he could make a profit off it. I asked him to let me know as soon as he found out what he was about to do as I did not want to be wasting time there, so next morning he said he would either sell to a draper on the other side of the street or by auction but would pay all my expenses and give me a week's salary, which he did. I returned to Melbourne and found after paying expenses that I was Â£3 in pocket. 
I got this situation a week ago arriving here on Thursday evening 5th November. I am getting 50s. a week and premiums which will make it about 55s. or 60s. I can count on the former at any rate. I am in the dress department. 
Echuca which is a native name, means the meeting of the waters. It is built on the Victorian side of the Murray, the longest river in Australia (3,000 miles) at the junction of the river Compaspie which is a Victorian river. There is a half holiday on Wednesday afternoon. Prince of Wales birthday was on Monday last which is always a holiday. Well arrangements were made to take the whole day on Wednesday and work on Monday and have an excursion in a steamer 20 miles down the Murray. We started about 9am this morning and had a very pleasant run down the river, stopped on the New South Wales side and had a picnic, that is some of our own shop hands and my landlord and lady; he is our book-keeper. There were all the other shopkeeper's assistants on the steamer also, and everybody else that was willing to pay their half crown in all about 250 or 300 people. We started on our return trip about 4.30pm and after a pleasant run arrived here shortly after 6 o'clock. 
The river is very crooked but deep and a good width say 130 yards wide. I believe it is much wider further down where some other large rivers join it. There is a large shipping trade done in wool and grain from both New South Wales and Victoria sides, and Echuca is the chief port as the wool and grain can be transferred from the barges to the train for Melbourne. The barges are towed by steamers which are also loaded, the load of both if in wool 2,100 bails, if in wheat 4,500 bags - some money's worth I wish I had it. 
Echuca is lit with gas and supplied with water from the Murray which is pumped by steam into two large tanks about 100 ft. high which gives it pressure in the pipes. The water is good and wholesome, much better than in Melbourne and the supply never runs done. I like the place so far as I have seen of it. I believe it is hot at times, sometimes as high as 120 in the shade. We had it 102 in the shade in Melbourne ten days ago. 
John is very busy about the bee keeping and making hives, so he will have not time to write this mail. They had got 20 swarms when I left town. They were likely to get orders for some hives (boxes) which would pay them well for their work. John is in high hopes about the undertaking and thinks it will pay. He was very well and improving when I saw him
