The hall and approaches were completely transformed by exquisite and artistic adornments. Nothing so complete and perfect in the way of decorations has ever been attempted in Melbourne, and a lady recently returned from a visit to England declares that she saw nothing more perfect at the houses of the leaders of London society. The long corridor one has to traverse en route to the ballroom was a scene of almost Oriental splendour. Numerous mirrors lined the walls - . - and crimson and gold Oriental curtains, draped in a most artistic style, covered the intervening wall space.. . The walls  were completely hidden by mirrors and draperies, overhung with garlands of greenery and flowers . . - The whole of the front of the platform was concealed by mirrors which reflected every movement of the gay throng of dancers. Behind these was a perfect forest of palms, ferns, greenery and masses of flowers, among which fairy lights twinkled like the firefly of tropical forests. Herr Plock's full band was quite hidden by this alcove of green - . . Supper was served at twelve o'clock in the large supper-room, the long ascent to which was handsomely adorned, the landings on the stairway being perfect little bowers of greenery.
After the reception dancing was at once proceeded with, and kept up far into the 'wee sma hours' - . - The programmes will, no doubt, be kept as souvenirs by the guests. They were in the form of tiny books, with covers of crimson morocco, the pencils attached by gold cord and tassels. The gowns worn on this occasion were most handsome, scarcely one having been seen before. The following were a few of the most noticeable: - Mrs F. Fitzgerald, white brocade, the front of petticoat being covered with honiton lace. Mrs T. Fairbairn, beautiful shade of pale heliotrope satin, relieved with gold. Mrs Alexander Landale wore a handsome gown of gold coloured brocade, with petticoat of satin trimmed with gold passementerie.
