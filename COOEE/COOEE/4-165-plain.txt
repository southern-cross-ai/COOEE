 you will be delighted to know that I am a Rechabite. Some of you will know what that order is. It is a very strong society here. First members require to be total abstainers and to be such for sometime before they are allowed to join. By paying about 1s. 3d. per week you have the benefit of a doctor without any further fee and after being joined a year members are entitled to Â£1 per week in case of injury or ill health that may prevent them from business or work. 
You will also be pleased to know that I purchased a block of land containing 4 allotments. It isn't much but still it may be a good deal some day. It is big enough to build 4 cottages on. The Hannas bought some of the same. We got a chance of it cheap  
I am still with Mr. Agnew and getting along well. I am round the city every alternate morning taking orders. My health is pretty good but occasionally troubled with indigestion especially when I don't take enough exercise.
