 it was arranged that two of our party viz. Frank and Eddie Beggs would start on Friday morning with a trap and convey the victuals and 3 tents one of which was large enough to accommodate 14 ladies and the other two were for the gents. Our friends did not get to the arranged camping ground until the following evening owing to the state of the roads. The remainder of the party went by rail to Lilydale, thence coach to Fernshaw a distance of 15 miles  the place selected for camping was on the side of the Black Spur Mountain.
