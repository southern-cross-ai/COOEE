Here he has good hours, good wages and half a holiday once a week besides all other public holidays. To this I may add that he has formed a great many acquaintances some of the feminine gender who he has introduced me to are the finest I have the honour of being acquainted on this side of the line. 
Echuca is a quiet country town occupying about five times as much ground as it ought compared with the number of houses and the population. It has been designed for a large town but its progress was stopped and it has greatly decreased since the railway passed over the Murray and on to Denilquin, up till that time it being the terminus and a great emporium of the cattle and horse trade of New South Wales, the stock being transported across the river in a boat. 
The country surrounding is quite flat, not as much as a mountain to relieve the eye in the distance. Although the climate is very dry there is a little tillage farming, the soil being admirably suited, being very rich. 
Doctor Graham a medical practitioner in this town has been giving a number of lectures instructing how to attend patients in case of accidents or otherwise when a surgeon is not at hand.

The Doctor will enter into instruction more minutely and each student or member will be furnished with a handbook with instructions how to deal with accidents etc. etc
