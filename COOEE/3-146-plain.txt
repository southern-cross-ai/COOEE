I have for some time felt that I should prefer earning my own living, to being dependant on you, as I now am, and have formed a project which I think must meet with your approbation.
I will study pretty closely, during the next twelve months the common course of an English education, the rudiments of the French language and Theory of music; I would then, open an infant School under 12 years of age undertaking to prepare them thoroughly for a higher school, and to teach the elder children the stepping stones to Music, French, and Drawing (things which I know are very little attended to in other schools, because the pupils must practice and so no time is left for theory, but which is nevertheless very important).
I would charge for each pupil, 2 Guineas per quarter and supposing I only had 4 pupils; this would amount to 32 Guineas the year, (sufficient to clothe myself and one of the children but, it is not improbable that I should have 12 or 15.
If my plan succeeded, in a short time I might engage teachers for accomplishments, which would further add to my own gains.
The school hours would commence at 1 / 2 past 9 and close at 4, as others do, allowing me plenty of time to rest, beside the periodical holidays, so that, you see, I should not be overworked, but find a pleasant occupation profitable.
If I gained enough I might be able to pay for Music Lessons for myself and Mary and of course I should continue to teach her as before.
Do not throw this aside as a foolish, girlish idea for really I am in earnest and should feel very, very much happier if I saw any prospect of rendering myself independant, and do not think it would be any sacrifice on my part for I shall feel much gratified if you consent to my plan.
I should be in my 20th year at the time I mention
I REMAIN / My DEAR FATHER / YOUR AFFECTIONATE DAUGHTER / MENIE
