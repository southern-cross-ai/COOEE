Dear Brown,
I was much pleased on receiving yours of the 15th of March. Since that time you must have had several of mine having written five since leaving Old England stating how we were getting on in Australia. I hear letters are very apt to miscarry, I am led to think so many friends not acknowledging the receipt of mine I find. Mrs. B. and yourself have made up your minds to emigrate here there is no doubt of your succeeding well if you can put up with the inconveniences - Land is increasing much in value. Mr. Hardey sold a small farm for 3.10.0 an acre inferior land but a short distance from Perth. Yanjedin which cost us 1600 pounds could have been got for one or two hundred some time ago and our agent says he can get for the same 2000, Robert thinks more. A  purchased a lot of land for from 4 pence or 5 pence an acre and sold half for 1700 pounds, 5 shillings per acre. Some land at the Toojay 12000 acres that we should have had for 1500 pounds was sold for 16 or 1800 pounds.
In former letters I told you the prices of sheep, cows and horses, they are now about the same, most likely the latter and the former will fall in value should there not be an increase in emigration, also they are sending sheep from Sydney and Launceston. If you bring stock a stallion of the Suffolk Punch breed, two or three good mares will answer. We purchased a mare and colt for 150 pounds that in England may be got for about 20 pounds each, we sold the filly for 100 pounds and can get if we please 140 pounds for the mare which will pay us well. A good strong stallion would answer. Mr. Smith and several others recommend a few yearling calves, the former the Dunham  breed. a bull if Simeon can get one of Mr. George Brown of Arcbury  . Sheep I do not think will answer your purpose without you wish to have any particular sort such as the Saxony or Leicester or Marino. Mr Smith does not like the pigs here and thinks a boar or sow or two of the Berkshire breed would be best.
I have many making enquiries about land for you but cannot get any quite near us that is suitable. There is an Estate about 12000 acres named Avondale about 6 miles from us can be got at 5 shillings per acre, the market price is about 3/6, there is also joining I think about 3000 acres at 3 shillings, the only objection to the latter is want of water, it is uncertain whom the Pool belongs otherwise it would be a good investment. I will not purchase land for you without I think it good particularly expecting you so early. 
It will be indispensable to bring servants, men and women, let them agree with you for a term say two or three years. I think there will be no difficulty procuring them. Shepherds can have here 40 pounds or upwards, common Labourers 5 shillings per day, Carpenters. Masons and Blacksmiths from ten to fifteen shillings for the same term - should you see two men that will suit us bring them, we care not if they are married if they pay their own passage money. We give 20 pounds a year for two or three years and keep them, they find their own clothes, also in the agreement specify that they are at our disposal at any hour or day not as in England leave off work at five or six oclock. Should you procure them they can assist you on Board if needful.
I have made every inquiry via Red Sea and India but think you will find it not answer your purpose, the correspondence betwixt this Colony and India is very uncertain, if you go that way send your servants direct to us and we will endeavour to take care of them until your arrival. We are 70 or 80 miles from Freemantle but as soon as I hear of the ship's entering Harbour I will hasten to you. I am told the best accomodation will be found at Mrs. Paces Hotel but should I miss you by any means I would have you bring Mrs. Brown direct to us in Yorkshire, the address you will see at the back of the letter although we should be easily found out. I will now leave Mrs. Viveash to give Mrs. Brown what information she can. Robert also talks of writing. Remember me to your better half, the Bussey's, and all friends. I remain
Dear Brown
Yours truly
S.W. Viveash
There is a man at Mr. Smith's who wished to come with us, if of the same mind bring him. One of our people says there is a man and woman at Maldon named Henry Masdon without children would be glad to come here. There is also a man named Quartermaine wife and one child I know will and indeed almost fixed to come with me, if they will, bring them for us. Should you bring more men than you require they will find plenty employment and be glad to get of for higher wages. I have written this scrawl in such an hurried manner I fear you will scarce make it out.
Be sure to have a written agreement with the Captain.
As you are coming if opportunity offer I will purchase a few sheep for you and put them with our flock at the usual terms.
