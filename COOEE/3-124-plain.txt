"MY EVER BELOVED ADA,
As my letters to you are necessarily long ones, I have on this occasion made choice of a full-sized sheet of foolscap to bear the burthen of what I have to say. Your dear letter reached my hands last night, and here, on Sunday, in the solitude of my sitting-room, I draw a little occasional table to the fire and jot down an answer as briefly as I may. 
"When your loving missive reached me, I had only returned from Springfields, the princely seat of W. P. Faithfull, Esq., late Member for the county of Argyle, where I had paid a visit of three nights and two days. Mr. Faithfull came into Goulburn in his gig for the purpose of driving me out to his magnificent domain, which is about twelve miles from this place, and I was, in fact, forced to go. Very pleasantly I spent the time; nevertheless, so intensely do I detest visiting that when the white front of Mandelson's Hotel came in sight, as Mr. Faithfull brought me back to Goulburn, I felt almost as if I saw home. Faithfull is a grand specimen of an Australian, built on a scale of giant proportions, but with a mind honest, simple, and gentle as a child's. Walking over the hills and spacious plains of lordly Springfields, we spoke together even about his most private affairs as though we had known each other twenty years. His heart is entirely wrapped up in having his children mentally cultivated ; they have hitherto enjoyed the rare blessings of a home education, the grandest training of all, from their mother and aunt, and he wishes, if possible, to protect their purity by obtaining for them a polished domestic tutor, instead of sending them to school, with the risk of having them spoiled and demoralised there. His eldest son is one of the noblest looking children I have ever seen. Mrs. Faithfull and her sister, Miss Deane, are ladies in the truest sense of the word, cultured, amiable, and kind, and though each has the reputation of being proud as Juno, I got on with them charmingly. Now for something to startle your nerves. I, Daniel Henry Deniehy, poor as a church mouse, and without just now one hundred and seventy shillings to my credit, but who am nevertheless up here supposed to be well off, because of my style and the company I frequent when I do go out, - I, the aforesaid Daniel Henry Deniehy, during my absence at Springfields, was victimised by having my name forged to a cheque on the Bank of New South Wales for £170. There is a very sad element in the business, however. As these letters take the place of my home gossip for you, dearest, I shall give you the particulars of an affair which has utterly ruined the foolish and unhappy perpetrator of it. I have always, and always will, by precept and example, stand up against the world's cowardly cruelty of 'throwing water on a drowning rat.' 
"This man Kean, who had been tried, convicted, and punished for a forgery (you will remember I told you he was for some short period a client at Stenhouse and Hardy's), had been at Goulburn some time before me. I saw him striving and penitent enough, a clerk here at the office of the Goulburn Herald. 
"No one in the town but an official, a kind-hearted, generous man, and myself, knew his wretched secret, that he was a Cockatoo Island expiree. One of the most ladylike and amiable young women in this same place, a niece of Captain Hovell, the Resident Commissioner for Crown Lands, was foolish enough to set her affections on the stout, broad-faced, elderly person of Kean. I did everything in my power for him, showed him every attention at my hotel, and would eventually perhaps have been able to use my influence in pushing him on. But Kean is a hopeless drunkard, and I may add also that his moral principles are like wax when temptation assails him. All his horrible sufferings have been insufficient to reform him. However, I kept his miserable secret from my most confidential friends, those whom, as well as some of the most distinguished men in the country, he had met in my apartments at Mandelson's. This unfortunate and equally wretched and unprincipled man, while I was from town, in a fit of drunkenness, in his own language 'to raise the wind,' drew a cheque in my name for £170, and obtained £2 on it from a tailor. For two reasons it did me no harm - firstly, because I had no funds in the bank it was drawn upon, nor, God wot, in any other in this universal creation ; and, secondly, even if I had, the signature was quite unlike mine, and the whole thing was so clumsily done that, Heaven help the poor wretch, it was like a child's attempt at forgery. The cheque was drawn in favour of my esteemed friend, John O'Sullivan, Esq., Manager of the Commercial Bank at Goulburn. The strangest part of the business is that the man who gave the two pounds to Kean on the cheque, dropped it in the street, some one picked it up, who, seeing Mr. O'Sullivan's name on it, took it to that gentleman, who knowing at a glance that it was a forgery, hurried to the hotel to acquaint and warn me. I was, of course, absent at Springfields. But before I had returned, the matter had spread over Goulburn, and there is little doubt, such is the opinion entertained of me here, that had a bad use of the cheque been made amongst the storekeepers, some seventy or eighty pounds' worth of goods might have been obtained on it. I heard all about it on my return; and as Mr. Faithfull could not drive back his lengthy road till late in the afternoon, he, of course, dined with me. We met Mr. Francis Macarthur in the street, and I asked him to join us, which he did. At dinner, Macarthur said, looking very grave and uneasy, 'Have you seen O'Sullivan ? If you have not, go, my dear fellow, at once; somebody has been trying to play a very serious trick with you.' After dinner, Macarthur and myself walked down to O'Sullivan's, and there got the cheque. Kean, I believe, had no intention of defrauding me, although he thinks me as well off as when he first knew me. 
"The talk about this matter has disclosed the existence, in Goulburn, of a man who had been a fellow-prisoner of Kean's at Cockatoo, and the fact is now, I fear, pretty generally known in the town, so that his chance here is blasted. Yesterday I met the miserable man on the promenade, as I was walking to the Post Office. He came up to me, agonised and white as a corpse. 'Oh, sir,' he implored, ' save me, save me from ruin.' I spoke sternly, though I only felt the deepest sorrow for the unhappy creature. I said, 'Mr. Kean, for your reputation and your chances here it is too late; never mind what you have done or tried to do to me, in the matter I have no feeling but pity with regret; what is it you wish me to do for you?' 'Oh,' he exclaimed, 'the legal consequences of my act, the cheque which will bear witness against me.' I drew the fearful evidence of his guilt from my pocket, saying, 'Mr. Kean, do you know that? do you not recognise there a proof of your own unworthiness and want of principle - did you not write my name at the foot of that ?' He clasped his hands and groaned, 'Yes, yes I did,' 'Then,' I said, 'suffer not a moment longer;' and I tore the paper into a hundred shreds before him. I then told him how well I knew of all his dishonourable doings, springing from his wretched craving for drink; how he had borrowed petty sums from the very waiters at my hotel ; how he had carried away liquor from the landlord without paying for it; I reminded him that as those things would not have been supplied him but for having been seen in my society, I felt bound as a gentleman to pay for them; I trusted it would be the last time such things would occur. I told him, too, that rather than see him criminally prosecuted for obtaining money under false pretences, I would pay the £2 he had received from the tailor on the cheque,- I could do no less, my wife, since I had known him in better days,- but because of his disgraceful conduct our acquaintance must then and there cease. The end of this miserable story has brought me to the end of my sheet. I will write again to-morrow.
