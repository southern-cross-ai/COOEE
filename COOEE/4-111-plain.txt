I say half a notion for I never take a great deal of notice of people coming to Australia until I see they have taken their passage. However as James is so much troubled with coughs and colds I believe it is the best thing he could do. 
In fact I have been inclined to think, but perhaps I am mistaken, that the whole family would do well to come out and take up land. They could select about 2,000 acres and as good horses sell at a good price (as high as at home) about Melbourne there could be a better living made out here at breeding horses. A good draught horse trained to harness will bring about Â£40 and a very good one more. Good carriage horses bring full better prices than at home but bits of saddle and spring cart - horses are not worth rearing.
