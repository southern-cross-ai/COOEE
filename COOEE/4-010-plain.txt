 You would read the papers I sends you giving accounts of the bushrangers Kellys who I am sorry to say are sons of Irish parents  I am sorry to say that my nearest neighbour of whom I spoke in my letters to you is dead - the same woman that made clothes for me and diggers. Since her death her husband has been unlucky enough like me at digging; hard times just now with the miners and trade dull.  He talks of leaving here and go to near Melbourne to try and get work on the roads for the government. Lots of men can't get any about Castlemaine now. They complain so much of the Chinese men keeping them poor and of the government allowing the emigration of more to there colonies. If my neighbour go away I am advised to shift to some place as it would not do for me to be alone.  As to digging for gold I have not done much good like other miners since I came home from the hospital. It is a very difficult task to find gold now about where I lives
