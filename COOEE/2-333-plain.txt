Christian Friends - It is proposed, if God permit, to begin a great work in your village - that work is the building of a school-house for a week-day school, and providing teachers capable of giving sound and useful instruction to such children as may become scholars. This is, in truth, a great work for education; a sound education, based on Christian principles, puts the young in possession of means which will enable them to turn to the best account the powers of body and mind which God has given them.
As the Minister of the Church at Walkerville I am most anxious that this work should go forward for your sakes - yes, for your sakes - it is the good of all of you that is sought. 
Now, you cannot expect this school to be built unless every resident in the place comes forward and does what he is able towards the carrying out of this object. Let no one of you deceive himself that his assistance will be but little, and that he is therefore justified in doing nothing.
Many, not in any way connected with the place, have promised their aid, but you cannot suppose that others will help you if you shew no disposition to help yourselves. Remember, as Christians, you are accountable to God for advancing or neglecting the best interests of your brethren. How then will you be held guiltless if you refuse to assist in the education of those about you?
Give us then, I would beg of you, your sincere prayers now, and your hearty assistance at the night of the meeting.
Your affectionate Minister,
T. P. WILSON.
