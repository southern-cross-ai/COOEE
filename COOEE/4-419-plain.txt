Mr. DEAKIN:  
It is but natural that, in addressing an assembly of this description, we should be at every turn confronted with memories of its predecessor in these colonies. The Convention which sat in the City of Sydney in 1891 gave a first tentative form to the proposals for federation with which we had been familiar for many years. It is but natural that presence in such an assembly should remain one of the recollections - the deepest recollections-of a lifetime, and it is perhaps inevitable that at every stage of the proceedings which we are here witnessing one should be struck with the similarities and differences between the two gatherings. To these even frequent allusions may not be out of place, since the aim of both gatherings was the  and his adhesion meant a great deal-to the principles of responsible government, as exhibited in the British Constitution. From an entirely different standpoint, under precisely similar circumstances, with very different arguments, the present Premier of New South Wales has arrived at exactly the same conclusion; and, taking into account the masterful ability of his speech, the position he occupies, and the influence he rightly wields, I believe we shall discover that his speech of to-day presents just such another turning point in the development of the thought of this Convention. It should fix the form of the future Federal Executive, and its relation to its Parliament. Another happy parallel in our proceedings has been the unanimity with which the Hon. E. Barton was chosen to fill the high office of Leader of the Convention, enjoyed by the distinguished federalist Sir S. Griffith in 1891. Our work is safe in his capable hands. I must confess that the urgency with which the necessity of compromise has been put forward is rather apt to provoke in the minds of many a reflex determination not easily to part with our own opinions or yield to anything like a general flux of thought. I have not yet been able to note any general departure from what I have understood to be the customary modes of thought and opinions of those who have addressed this Chamber, but I do begin to feel, or think I feel, one of those undercurrents of feeling which sway even thoughtful and deliberate minds, and cause them to be drawn together by one common influence. My own opinions seem more malleable, and more capable of modification than I supposed while listening to speeches which I do not hesitate to say, so far as my poor judgment enables me to speak, are no whit inferior to those which ushered in the Commonwealth Bill of 1891. Those speeches have been delivered here in accordance with exactly the same procedure as was followed there, but have exhibited, in many cases, an entirely different standpoint-a changed atmosphere, an emergence of new points of view. Following speech after speech, starting in most cases from different, and sometimes from antagonistic, standpoints, it has become possible to gather what, if I understand it aright, is the general sense of this Convention on some grave issues which we are called upon to reconsider. recognise that the old problems of 1891 have every one emerged, but almost all with new faces. The natural processes of political thought in later years, and the discussions which we have listened to here combine together to present these old problems, to me at all events, in many cases in a new light. Had it not been for this, I should not have ventured to trespass upon the limited time that remains to us. If the point of view at which I have arrived be not new to others, I may be pardoned for the belief that it is by the presentation even of merely personal views that others may be, as I have been, largely, assisted. In the Commonwealth Bill it was my misfortune to be in the minority, and sometimes a small minority, on certain important points. On one or two of these points it appears to me that there is a prospect now that I may happen to be with the majority.
Mr. GORDON:  
Hear, hear.
Mr. DEAKIN:  
Nevertheless I would like to clear the way by admitting that were it a question to-day, as it was in 1891, of accepting the Commonwealth Bill or postponing Federation even for a few years, I should, without hesitation, accept the Commonwealth Bill. At the same time, as this Convention is assembled under a fresh mandate, delivered directly from the peoples of the several colonies, giving us immediate and direct authority to speak for them to the best of our power, I hold myself in no sense bound by any vote or speech in that Convention of 1891. Willing as I am to accept the Commonwealth Bill, I recognise the obligation, now laid upon us as a distinct obligation, to draft the best Constitution possible under the circumstances in which we find ourselves. I had at one time noted portions of those speeches of my predecessors in this debate which most appealed to me, with some idea of commenting on them should the opportunity arise, but I am about to abandon them because, though I am anxious to ex-press my indebtedness to many members for particular arguments on particular points - that personal obligation cannot stand against the general sense of urgency that is upon us to approach, after this thoughtful, useful, and essential discussion, the consideration of the details to which we must necessarily give form and shape without further delay. To pass without further preliminary to the first problem which confronted us in the Convention of 1891, in identically the same words in which it is presented to us here, I join in expressing, with my brother delegates, our acknowledgments to Sir Richard Baker for the searching speech in which he followed the opener of this debate. We were confronted with exactly the same problem in 1891, but on that occasion the challenge came from the lips of a member who was rarely heard in that Convention, but whose speeches contained the essence of the views of those who agreed with him, delivered in classic form and nervous English which few of them could hope to rival. Mr. Hackett, on the 12th of March, 1891, told us that-Either responsible government will kill Federation, or Federation, in the form in which we will be prepared to accept it, will kill responsible government.I am the more reminded of this, because at that time, those who, like myself, differed from the standpoint of Mr. Hackett, had the great advantage and satisfaction of having on our side the mature judgment and experience of no less a person than Sir Richard Baker. He had issued a manual which we had in our hands in 1891, in which, on pages 44, 45, and 46, he expressed his then opinion in regard to the possible forms the Executive of the Federation might assume. He pointed out to us that the Americans were not satisfied with the mode of conducting public business. Hon. members will see what he said on page 44-Some of them have cast longing eyes on England, and advocate the introduction of responsible government as the only cure for the evils under which they are suffering.He now recommends for our approval the Swiss form of Executive. Then he was able to say:In the first place we knew very little about it. It is said to work well in Switzerland, but even if that is so, it would be the rashest of assumptions to conclude that it would work well in Australia.He went on to add:The soil, the climate, the physical and political environment of Switzerland, the history, feelings, and sentiments of its people are so different from ours, and must exercise so important an influence on the working of its political institutions that any conclusions drawn from them is, to say the least, hazardous. In the past, experience has shown that all political institutions which have been lasting are of slow growth; that the ideas and sentiments which give rise to such institutions, and ensure their utility, must be as it were engrained in the people; and that imported and transplanted exotics have never flourished.I should seek in vain to express in language equally concise and well chosen the objections which operate upon my mind, and, probably, upon the minds of others, in regard to the application to our Federal Government of the system of the Swiss Executive.
Sir RICHARD BAKER:  
You forget that, in the second edition of that book, I said I had altered my mind after hearing the objections.
Mr. DEAKIN:  
If I had remembered that, I would have done the hon. member the justice of stating it, but it does not affect the purpose to which I wish to put this quotation, where finally he sums up:If the Swiss experiment is to be tried, let it be tried somewhere where it will do less harm if it  does not succeed; and let us adhere to the system of responsible government, under which we have been born and bred, and which, with all its faults and imperfections, has worked at least as well as any other system adapted to Republican institutions.Now whilst we are all aware that the hon. gentleman has changed his opinion, and no doubt has in his own mind good reason for changing his opinion, it is unfortunate that he did not favor us with a statement of a single reason which has led him to depart from that weighty argument then placed before us. He told us that he favored the Swiss Executive. He might have told us that he admired the beautiful scenery of that interesting country, but as to how he proposed to transfer its glacial Alpine heights and acclimatise them upon the sunny plains of Australia, he left us entirely in the dark. Consequently I feel justified in sparing the time of this Convention by putting in his own words, much better than I can express it, what seem to be unanswerable objections to the recommendation which he made to this Convention. In addition to that I might add that, as the hon. the Premier of New South Wales indicated this morning, we find the ground of choice by no means free and clear for such an innovation. In point of fact, those who ask us to accept the Swiss Executive do so forgetting that it would be introduced as an intermediary government above colonies which will preserve responsible government as we have always known it-so far, at all events, as we can at present judge. The peoples in these colonies have been trained wholly under responsible government and live in those colonies under that form of government, having above them the Imperial Government of England based upon exactly the same lines, upon the same principles, and upon the same traditions. It is actually suggested that between these responsible governments-the Imperial Government above and the responsible governments of the States below-in an Empire which has known no other form of government-we should interpose an entirely novel form with which our people are absolutely unfamiliar. Surely Federation, as we know it, is surrounded by problems enough, and difficulties enough, which must be surmounted in order to win the adherence of the people of the several colonies, without adding to these sometimes unpalatable proposals this entirely unexpected, and, to my mind unnecessary innovation of requiring them not merely to vote aye or nay for union, but of voting for the union to accept also what is to us an entirely new and untried system of government. Of course, the facts are, as the authorities upon the Swiss Government remind us, that the constitution which, in its present form, does not date back half a century, is slowly changing its form. We are told that their ministers, who previously were extremely limited in their departmental authority, are acquiring more and more influence. We are told that the inclination to elect the Executive as one whole on party lines is becoming more and more manifest. I may add to those who think to force the Swiss form of government upon this country, upon a people politically earnest and politically alert, your mere paper constitution would be twisted between their fingers in twelve months back into its present shape. Your Executive would be made answerable as a whole to the electors-
