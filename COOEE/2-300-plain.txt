My Dear Sir,
You will no doubt think me a curious sort of a being for not having called for you in this time - the truth is, I have been over head and ears in business which I hope will plead as a excuse for my impoliteness. Mr. Atkinson is just setting off for the new Country, where he remained for a fortnight my seeing you this week is rather uncertain as I cannot rightly leave this Shop.
I hope the palpitation of the old boy's heart has ceased, and that it has improved his generosity.
If you are going his length today I wish you would  him I will not require the needful for a month, and if he could not give me the whole Â£300 try if he will 2 - but do all you can for me which will be held for ever in remembrance. I trust that your better half and all the  are enjoying their usual good health. Believe me ever
My Dear Sir, Yours very Sincerely,  Crawford
