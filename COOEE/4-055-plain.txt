Why for the simple reason I could not stop you. Do you forget how I used to struggle to get free? But I was held as in a vice, so finding struggles useless I submitted, but I suppose I might as well be honest and confess that it was not always disagreeable to be fondled, but I did not always deem it prudent, you naughty boy. Ah well that's all gone and past, it's your love I have now and I have given you mine without reserve, Alick is mine and I am his, I love you fully and freely and I am so happy in the possession of your love darling, I can afford now to laugh at the past when we were cousins together and to me at least nothing more than cousins. 
Nor can I understand how anyone can go on being in love one week with one girl and next week with another. It's not love, it can't be, maybe they fancy it is but its mere fascination, and the spell is soon broken, it's not in human nature to be always changing one's affections. The person who does so has never been really in love, for if love for a girl or reverse the case if a girl loves any young man, all her feelings raise against making believe she is in love, week after with someone else and just the same with a man don't you think so? I think you know enough about the marriage ceremony without my teaching you, of course you don't know that I have to promise to obey you? And I won't satisfy you by having a string of pretty bridesmaids either.
