When I say manage I mean that I will only have to manage myself, the store and a horse, no under-hands. My wages for a start are £1 per week and myself and horse found in all but clothes (the horse clothes himself). 
When I said I was going farming I really intended to do so and did in fact put in a fortnight ring-barking and felling. But this job which is permanent and out here a gentleman's billet was too good to be lost so as I had only paid £6 or £7 on the land in work and cash I let it go to Government. If the store should be a failure I will go to the fields (Gold). A fellow never knows what his luck is going to be till he tries and anything is better than knocking about at contract work or navvying on railways. 
When I come to think over it all, I can see that it is the best thing that could have happened to me my coming out here. I always succeed everywhere I go and as I have never let liquor cross my lips nor done anything mean or ungentlemanlike I am well liked and get into the elites of society. You would not believe the offers I get of employment of all sorts. I can't go wrong. It would open your optics to see me falling, all sweat and charcoal and the next day mounted on my thoroughbred (Rainbow) on a £6 6s. 0d. saddle togged up to the nines going to a ball or cricket match. I am invited down to the coast to some very nice people for a fortnight's duck and swan shooting and sea fishing not to mention a little flirtation with the pretty daughters. As far as money goes I have enough and to spare though I want more like everybody else  
I was offered £150 and found !! a year to go up to the Murchison district (North) to keep a store but my life would not be worth a kangaroo's owing to the fever and ague. You will wonder at my getting this offer and my present billet but you must bear in mind the illiterate state of a people without schools and descended for the most part from convicts.
