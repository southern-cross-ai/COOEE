The intending purchaser would give £500 in 12 months. I would have bought a store here in the mining town I am now in situated about 13 miles from Powalup as the crow flies. I am getting now 10s. 0d. per day of eight hours. I get the extra 1s. 0d. to camp with the tin down on the washing site with a gun to keep tin thieves off at night. 
I don't think I ever told you I was robbed myself at the farm and caught the thief who had stolen my horse and saddle and all my belongings. I had my rifle with me of course and laid him out with the butt end. He has been in the asylum ever since from the effects of the blow. 
Since I've been here I was robbed again but the police caught the thief and I recovered one article, the revolver which I had marked and could swear to.
