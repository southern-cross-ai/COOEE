I believe he is troubled with asthma but he takes great care of himself. We were very much vexed when he went away as we miss his company and it made it like home. He intends going to his selection very soon as he is making preparations for going. Yambulla is the name of the townland on or near the banks of the Tambo river Gippsland. James made application for a selection adjoining John's and met the Land Board at Bairnsdale on 17th of last month; had a letter from him last week saying he was trying to get a transfer to one on the other end of John's which it seems is better than the one he first applied for. If James gets either of these John will be able to look after both and James and Hugh will stay at their business and make a little money. John thinks he will be able to make a living from bees as they do well in the country and it would be easier looking after them than hard work.
