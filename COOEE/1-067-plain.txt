Making the French Commodore acquainted with my intentions of Settling Van Dieman's Land, was all I sought by this Voyage, Mr. Robbins overtook them on the Day the Naturaliste parted Company with the Geographe to return to France, I have the honor to enclose the French Commodore's Answer to my Letter with my Remarks thereon.  
Under all these Circumstances I judged it expedient to form a Settlement at Risdon Cove in the River Derwent, the situation of which their Lordships will observe in Captain Flinder's Chart of Storm Bay Passage in Van Dieman's Land; This Measure I should have taken sooner if I had any proper Person to send on that Service; On the Glattons arrival Lieut. Bowen of that Ship offered his Services, and being recommended by Captain Colnett who gave his Consent, I took it upon me to appoint Mr. Bowen in conjunction with the Commander of the Porpoise to fix on a suitable Place, and command the intended Settlement until I may receive Instructions on that Subject. As no Medical assistance could be spared from the Colony, and the Surgeon of the Glatton having Captain Colnetts consent and recommendation I appointed him to the Medical Duty of the intended Settlement where his assistance to Lieut. Bowen will be very useful. My reasons for making this Settlement are : - the necessity there appears of preventing the French gaining a footing on the East side of these Islands; To divide the Convicts : - To secure another place for procuring Timber, with any other natural production that may be discovered and found useful The advantage that may be expected by raising Grain; and to promote the Seal Fishery: For these reasons and Utility of a Naval Officer's conducting a Settlement of that kind I was induced to accept Lieut. Bowen's offer, and Capt. Colnett's recommendation which I hope will meet their Lordships Approbation. It is my intention to dispatch the Porpoise and Lady Nelson on this Service as soon as possible after the Glatton's departure.
