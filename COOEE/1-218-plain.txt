The first part of your Lordship's Commands having been thus carried into its fullest effect by the zeal and Intelligence of Mr. Oxley, the Second will be proceeded upon the moment that the rainy Season concludes, by the Establishment in Moreton Bay of a few, not exceeding fifty Souls for the purpose of providing accommodation for themselves, and for the reception of any number of Convicts it may be deemed expedient to send hereafter.
