 John gave me a trial overhauling some bee frames. He has a job that will keep me going for a fortnight if I don't get another in the hardware line. I purpose calling with Mr. Agnew tomorrow as promised. He may have an opening or know of one. I would just as soon not take crib for a fortnight but will not refuse a good thing if it turns up.  I am most anxious about the bees. There would be more go to loss than I could gain out of a month's screw. John dropped into this billet (our situation) (as mentioned in last letter) a month too soon but it would not wait on him
