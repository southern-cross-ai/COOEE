My dear Miss Lewin, 
On arriving at Melbourne I sent you an Argus containing an account of the voyage made by the Swiftside which was a very pleasant & favourable one though a little longer than was expected being exactly 12 weeks. I hope you received the Argus else you will think it very strange never having heard anything of me. We only remained in Melbourne from Friday to Tuesday. My brother was there waiting for me. On Christmas Day we began our journey up the Country - went by rail to Ballarat. There Mr Hines' brother-in-law met us, we made all one party & were 12 in number. We drove up about 260 miles - used to start very early in the morning, rest in the heat of the day & make another start in the evening - the weather was very hot, more so than has been felt for the last 4 years. We had all kinds of adventures in the shape of kicking horses & broken poles but we reached Benyeo (the residence of Mr McLeod - brother-in-law to Mr Hines) on the following Sunday. 
It is 14 miles distant from this place - Mrs Hines & I were over here for a day or two - made all right for the children to come - but when we returned to Benyeo for them, Mrs Hines took measles & from that day which was not a week after we reached Benyeo up to the present there has been nothing but sickness. Just as Mrs H. was over the worst of measles the eldest girl was taken ill the day after her 12th birthday. She was affected very strangely & tho' a Doctor was sent for at once it was 48 hours before one arrived. Then Bessie was dangerously ill with inflammation of the lungs - about 10 days after she was first attacked measles came out on her slightly - the Doctors (for now there were two) thought she might now get better but her strength was all gone & she gradually sank & died at Benyeo last Saturday, exactly the day month of her birthday when she appeared in her usual health.
Her death has cast a great gloom on everything. She was a gentle companionable intellectual child liked by everyone who knew her - the second girl misses her sadly - Bessie was laid beside a brother in a small burying place adjoining the garden on Sunday & on Monday we all came over here for good - Every one at Benyeo who had not had measles before had them during the six weeks we were there - 15 cases in all. Fortunately I had had them & was able to look after some of the invalids.
I like the people I have met in Australia much better than I like what I have yet seen of the country but it is too soon to judge - I have experienced nothing but kindness from Mr & Mrs H. all through but particularly lately. We have done nothing yet with lessons - they brought out a beautiful piano, the only thing poor Mrs Hines now cares about - she idolized her eldest child. As soon as I receive any money I will remit it to you. Please give my kind compliments to Miss Rye,
hoping she & you are well I remain dear Miss Lewin Very truly yours,
