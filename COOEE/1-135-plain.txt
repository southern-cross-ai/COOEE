Dear Madam
Mrs. Marsden has requested me to write to you for a few Ribbons Sewing Silk &c. You will know what she will want. She will also thank you to send to Mr. Green Glover Newport St for about £5 worth of gloves. Mrs. Green knows what sort to send. I have directed Mr. Alexander Birnie to let you have £25 to pay for the Ribbons &c. You will have the goodness to send to Mr. Birnie for the money before you send the things out. He lives in great St Helens. Mr. Wilsons failing greatly deranged my little plans when in England and has given me sonic concern. I perhaps in the end shall not be ally great sufferer but this I cannot tell as I have received no acc either of the remittances which I sent home amounting to upwards of £1000 nor of my Salary since the day I left England.  Till I can obtain this I shall remain ignorant of my private affairs in England. I hope Mrs. Birnie will furnish me with this in time. I hope Mr. Stokes received the money I sent him on Mr. Hassall's a / c for the balance of his Account.
I am happy to say Mrs. M is much recovered all the rest of my family are well. My colleagues and families are well, and schoolmasters. We have now a prospect of doing good. A wonderful change has taken place since my return with respect to the Moral situation of the Colony. The Governor is very attentive to the Sabbath day and is a very moral man. A very good understanding has existed between him & me for some time past, he very readily meets all my wishes with respect to the good order and moral improvement of the Inhabitants. I must now work while it is day. I have applied for three more Clergymen and some Schoolmasters. Should you know of any that will answer me, will you communicate their names to Wilberforce. I have written to him on the subject. I am certain Government will allow of two more clergymen should none be sent out before this arrives.
This will become a great country in time and the Wool will soon make a remittance to the mother country. I send home by this vessel more than 8,000 lb. The last I sent to England averaged 3 / 9d per lb. What this will sell for I know not. Our wool will be fine in time. I always foresaw that wool would be of vast importance to this settlement and have now convinced the farmers here so that they will now attend to their flocks.
You will hear that King Pomare has embraced Christianity.
The New Zealand Chief who lived with me has at length got to his native land. I have heard the most flattering accounts of him and trust that he will open the way for the introduction of the Gospel into that Island.
God had very important designs in view when he induced the British Government to establish a colony here. Give my kindest respects to Mrs. Stokes your sons Thomas, Charles & George and also to Mr. and Mrs. Hughes and the Revd. Mr. Forster & Miss Searle in which Mrs. M. most cordially unites.  
I am
Dr. Madam
Yours most respectfully
SAMUEL MARSDEN.
