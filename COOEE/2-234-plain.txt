The female was also charged with leaving her hired service without permission. Brown pleaded guilty to the charges, and begged that Captain Smythe would take him into his service again, where he would work until his master's loss was repaired. This the complainant refused, alleging that Brown was considerably in his debt, and he was determined to have him punished; he was sentenced three months imprisonment. The woman, as it was suspected she had acted under the influence of her husband, was discharged.
