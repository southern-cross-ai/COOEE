 I had a letter from Hugh yesterday. It contains rather bad news about his land as the lands department decline to take the improvements already effected as sufficient to comply with the Act. However they have given him three months to complete same. It will put him about a bit as he is not financially in a position to comply with their request. It has been a source of trouble and worry from the beginning up to the present. However, I hope it will repay us later on.
