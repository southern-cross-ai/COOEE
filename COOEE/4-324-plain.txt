They were a splendid seed 5cwt. and we did not lift much over 10cwt. of marketable potatoes. They were planted rather early and got dry weather at first then rain later on which gave them a second growth. The later planted crop were Brown's River'. We had 8 cwt. seed from Mr. Davidson. They were indifferent looking seed. The ground was very dry when planted so there were a good few misses. However they got the little rain that was just in the nick of time and they now turn out a good average crop, are very good to eat. We only sold a few of the pink eyes. Mr. Wilson bought half a ton of Brown's River at Â£3 10s. per ton. Mr. P. Johnson, Mr. Simpson (Mr. Johnson's father-in-law), Mr. Sand and Mr. Somerville (Mr. Wilson's new neighbour on the north side) bought a few in cwts. at 4s. per cwt. 
Potatoes like everything else is very cheap at present in Victoria, "Warnambools" and "Colacs" from 20s. to 22s. 6d. per ton.  I saw it stated in the Australian that they had been sold as low in one district on the ground as 10s. per ton. I think Bruthen price is about from 2s. to 2s. 6d. per cwt. but we have the advantage of the extra price paid for carriage from Bruthen to the Crossing for 1s.6d. per cwt. Besides the Bruthen potatoes are not good this year.
J. Colven and I divide the profit after paying for the seed. The house supplied and the small ones for the hens against rent for garden. 
We have been burning off the dead wood in the 80 acres for some weeks back. It is slow work. It is our intention to drag the ashes down to the garden and use that as manure for next year's potato crop. 
Grass is likely to be scarce during the winter. Often rains have been very light and late in coming. Frosts have been bad a few nights the last fortnight. Splendid weather through the day for working but that does not bring the grass. 
Mr. Wilson is away at present at Bairnsdale with 130 old ewes (in lamb most of them) having too little grass to carry all his stock through the winter. He had in all nearly 900 head of sheep. He expects to get about 2s. for the ewes. If I had a paddock at my command I think I would have speculated. 
It is my intention at present to make a big effort and stock after next shearing unless I deem it advisable between now and October to change the programme. 
I consider the re-ringing of the big paddock in the front block and the burning off the dead wood in the 80 acres will increase the grazing capacity at least 30 per cent. 
With a fair season the 800 acres ought to carry 1,200 sheep. Of course, we could not stock that much but will try one block and letting the other. There are two cows milking at present. The old cow has been again turned out. Grass was getting scarce in the McDougall paddock and the cow had been in about 7 months. There is now 13 head of horned stock counting calves
