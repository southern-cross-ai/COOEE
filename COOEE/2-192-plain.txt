If a man finds it to his advantage to be honest he is honest, but let his own interest be interferred with and character, friendship, gratitude avail nothing - all are sacrificed and made subservient to the advancement of his own fortunes  It is indeed a strange land. The aristocracy of wealth is looked up to with veneration which the most sanguine Parvenue could hardly hope for in other countries. Parties whose birth, parentage and education wd. for ever preclude their being admitted into any society but of the lowest caste at service, thro its all powerful influence rank here among the Magistrates, and thanks to the liberal sentiments of Genl.

I need hardly tell you that the Tories rank among their number only the respectable class of people here and as a matter of course are far outnumbered. But they nevertheless maintain their position against the united forces of liberals and emancipists and did maintain it with firmness and consistency even when these two bodies were headed and supported by Sir Richd.

He is however gone, and I sincerely hope Sir Geo. Gipps will not follow in his footsteps, or imitate the mistaken line of politics he persevered in against the best interests of the Colony. I of course was made to feel the evil consequence of adopting the priviledge of thinking for myself, and was visited with the neglect that awaited all those, who exercised such a prerogative under a despotic Government. But as long as I remained in the Service I did my duty conscientiously
