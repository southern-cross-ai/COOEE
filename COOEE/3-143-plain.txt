Dear brother 
I avail myself of the opportunity of writing these few lines to you hoping to find you wife and family in good health as this leaves me and family at present thank god. I recd. your letter about the first of Jany. last and would have written an answer to you ere now were it not for I being paying Michl. Moores passage as required by you and I was waiting until I could mention all particulars to you about it.  I am Still under the care of Dr. Jacob and my eyes are mending only very Slowly. 
Mathew Hammersley has left me and has gone to the harvest about 3 months ago and John Hogan is with me Since. Mathew Hammersley's Sister is in Service near me and we recd. a letter from him a few weeks ago. He and his Sister are well and in good health as are all the friends. In consequence of low wages being in adalede Dora ryan has come over to melbourne and has 36 Â£ a year. She has had the pleasure of reading your letter and paper. She comes to See me occasionally. Your friend danl. ryan has gone to the ovens diggins. He promised to write to me a letter but he has not done So as yet. Michl. hogan of hospitle and family are well and in good health. He is worth from 200 to 300 pounds of shared money. 
John hogan requires if his brother could leave his parents to come to this country he would do well in this country. Whether he is married or Single he would press on him to come but he is Slow in doing So in consequence of how his parents and brother are circumstanced at home. I think he could Serves his parents or friends better in this country than in Ireland. Tell Mr Kilbride that I have got no account of his Son any more than that I heard about 3 years ago that he was then in Sydney. I would not Spare nor will not if I possibly can get any information respecting him, Spare any trouble. 
Dora ryan sees the hayes continually. One of them Jas. came over and borrowed 3 pounds of me and he going to the diggins and he never came near me since en. When parents dont give their children industrious habits they Seldom need expect them do much good afterwards. 
I have paid Michl. Moores passage through the government immigration. There is living with me a Servant girl named Mary Leamy formerly of the parish of emly and a cousin of John Leamy's of Solohead and She being Sending for a brother and a sister of hers we considered it the best and cheapest to bring them 3 out on the Same form. If you go to paddy hogans house this girl formerly lived near terry higginsis and any of terry higginsis children will make them out for you. 
As william ryan has left the carriers arms you have better direct your letter to, Michl. Hogan, South Melbourne. 
No more at present from Your affectionate brother 
Michael Hogan
