This is said to be a very bad country for liver complaint indeed the worst in the world not excepting India. I suppose it is partly the heat but it is hard to say what are all the causes. I hope father and mother are keeping free from it. I would suggest to you as a possible preventative of headache to pour some cold water on the back of the neck first thing every morning; it won't do any harm at any rate
