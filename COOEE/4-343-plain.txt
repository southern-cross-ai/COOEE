Government House, Sydney, Nov. 4th, 1896. 
Sir, - I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of October 31st, informing me that it is intended to hold a convention of the people at Bathurst this month for the purpose of discussing "the principles and details of Federation."
You ask me for an expression of opinion, and in reply I have no hesitation in saying that the promoters of the Bathurst Convention are doing a loyal work in their endeavour to impress the public mind with true conceptions of the magnitude of the problems involved in the creation of a federal authority, and of the great importance of defining clearly at the outset the division to be made between the sovereign powers to be surrendered to the federal authority and those to be retained by the federating States.
I assume that there is a general agreement that for purposes of foreign policy, internal commerce, and defence the federal is the only form of government which will provide Australia with efficient legislative and executive authorities, so that the question for solution is whether and by what methods Australia can be converted into one powerful State without any undue sacrifice of the autonomy of the colonies as they at present exist. My belief is that this problem is one which is capable of satisfactory settlement, and that to this end the Convention to be held at Bathurst will be doing work of inestimable value in promoting discussion on the question of Federation.
The present is a time of peace, and so it is the accepted time. The work can be done now with careful thought and by prudent action. If, however, the present opportunity is neglected, it may be that the call for united action will come upon the country in a time of stress and danger, when the want of a Federal Executive will paralyse the best efforts of the people in their self-defence. 
I am, Sir,
Your obedient Servant,
HAMPDEN.
