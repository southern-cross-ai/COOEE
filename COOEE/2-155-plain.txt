This is a very fine country not a finer in the world and a very wholesome climate  you need not be any way uneasy of the voyage as it will be the outside of it if you are three months on sea, I am with the best gentlemen in this colony and the wealthiest. I want for nothing  The two Egans are here with me on this farm where I am stationed. The two Egans are doing well. They are both in good health and desire to be remembered to their friends. The climate is purty hot. The Blacks are very numerous in this country and are quite savage. This is a very fruitful country. There is three crops in the year growed here so me wife there is nothing troubling me but for want of your presence which I hope I shortly will have. I hope that you wont delay as soon as you receive this that you will answer it  the gentlemen I am with they are I assure you very fond of me that whatever I require from them they give it me. We have got only one clergyman in this country which I am sure there would be ten wanted there the country is so large. As soon as you receive this you wont delay in seeing the gentlemen that will have my sentence mitigated  Don't be in anyway dismayed we shall be comfortable yet please God
