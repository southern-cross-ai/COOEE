Nor at all does a young lady of respectability dine or lunch alone with a gentleman, except in extraordinary cases, at restaurants or public lunching-places; she would have to run the risk of being thought of Bohemian tendencies if she did, and would assuredly be classified in her unprotected state, as in a lower stratum of society than she would like . . - Thus the young girl who is in the frequent habit of accepting a gentleman's escort to a place of public entertainment of any kind without the company of her mother, or elder sister, or some other person of presumed authority, can not help placing herself in a wrong light, although she does nothing wrong in itself.
The same principle is involved in the matter of driving. On horseback or afoot the parks and highways are as free to her and her escort as another; but driving, except with an acknowledged lover, is to be done with caution, and if the other occupant of the vehicle is a married man, it is seldom to be done at all, except at the serious risk of reputation.
The universal civilty  of railway and station employees makes obligations to others unnecessary, and the young lady who is not able to travel with a maid, and has no chaperon, had better travel alone always being sure of respect and attention.  The tender bloom of innocence is so beautiful in the young, that we long to preserve it by any means in our power
For the middle-aged woman, the woman of public occupation, or even the woman who has declared her intention of leading a single life, many of these rules are inapplicable, and to such, a freedom is allowed that is utterly forbidden to the young and tender daughter shielded by her home from the public, and also shielded from much by her youth. About this young and tender daughter, people are beginning to think the lines that keep off the rude touch of the world can not be drawn too closely, or the safeguards made too many. Less restriction may be hers at an age when she is supposed to be better acquainted with the world and with herself; but in her early youth she is to honor and obey certain rules.
