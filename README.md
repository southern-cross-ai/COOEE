# A COrpus of Oz Early English (COOEE)

## Overview

Material to be included had to meet a regional and a temporal criterion. The latter required texts to have been produced between 1788 and 1900 in order to become eligible for COOEE. It was mandatory for a text to have been written in Australia, New Zealand or Norfolk Island. But in a few cases, other localities were allowed. For example, if a person who was a native Australian or who had lived in Australia for a considerable time, wrote a shipboard diary or travelled in other countries. 

Contains: **Letters**, **published materials** in book form, **historical texts**. 

The collection is stratified in two ways: 

- Time period - The corpus is divided into four time periods (the initial numeral of each file name indicates the period from which the document comes): 
  - Period 1: 1788-1825 
  - Period 2: 1826-1850 
  - Period 3: 1851-1875 
  - Period 4: 1876-1900 
- Register - The corpus contains material from four registers (the register to which a file belongs is specified in the metadata at the start of each file in the form <r=[register]> using the abbreviations above):
  - Speech-based (sb)
  - Private written (prw)
  - Public written (pcw)
  - Government English (ge)
