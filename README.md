# COrpus of Oz Early English (COOEE)

## Overview

**Keywords**: Australian and New Zealand English; Corpus linguistics

The [COrpus of Oz Early English (COOEE)](https://researchdata.edu.au/corpus-oz-early-english/2013) is an innovative linguistic project aimed at creating a comprehensive digital repository of English language usage in Australia from its **early colonial period** through to the **early 20th century**. 

It compiles a diverse range of texts, including **letters**, **newspapers**, **legal documents**, **diaries**, and **literary works**, offering a rich and multifaceted perspective on the language used by Australiaâ€™s early settlers, convicts, and indigenous peoples interacting with English.

## Dataset Structure

The dataset under `COOEE/COOEE` includes 1357 plain `.txt` files and 1 metadata `.json` file collected from [LDaCA - A COrpus of Oz Early English (COOEE)](https://data.ldaca.edu.au/collection?id=arcp%3A%2F%2Fname%2Cdoi10.26180%252F23961609&_crateId=arcp%3A%2F%2Fname%2Cdoi10.26180%252F23961609). It is arranged in the following two ways:

- **Time period** - The corpus is divided into four time periods (the initial numeral of each file name indicates the period from which the document comes): 
  - Period 1 (1788-1825): includes 268 `.txt` files, e.g., `1-001-plain.txt`.`
  - Period 2 (1826-1850): includes 364 `.txt` files, e.g., `2-001-plain.txt`.`
  - Period 3 (1851-1875): includes 306 `.txt` files, e.g., `3-001-plain.txt`.
  - Period 4 (1876-1900): includes 419 `.txt` files, e.g., `4-001-plain.txt`.
- **Register** - The corpus contains material from four registers (the register to which a file belongs is specified in the **metadata** at the start of each file in the form <r=[register]> using the abbreviations above):
  - Speech-based (sb)
  - Private written (prw)
  - Public written (pcw)
  - Government English (ge)
